# Rules

Amaranth and Whitewolf's games (Vampire, Werewolf, Mage and others) have a similar set of rules, since they're based on Storyteller. It has its own set of particular rules, and those make playing with Amaranth a different experience.

- **[Tests](/rules/tests):** general rules for tests and rolls
- **[Sheet](/rules/sheet):** character sheet and its elements
	- **[Flaws](/rules/sheet/flaws):** physical or personality traits that give freebie points (and are usually negative)
	- **[Merits](/rules/sheet/merits):** physical or personality traits that cost freebie points (and are usually positive)
	- **[Attributes](/rules/sheet/attributes):** character's personality traits
	- **[Abilities](/rules/sheet/abilities):** character's talents, skills and knowledge
	- **[Backgrounds](/rules/sheet/backgrounds):** character's traits that may represent their backstory
