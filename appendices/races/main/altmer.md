The **[Altmer](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)**, or self-titled "Cultured People", are a tall, golden-skinned race, hailing from **[Summerset Isle](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Summerset_Isles)**. They are also known as **High Elves** by the denizens of **[Tamriel](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**, or the more obscure term Salache, High Elves are generally viewed as being proud or snobbish. Altmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Altmer being old and a 300-year-old Altmer being very, very old. Altmer consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Tamriel; the common tongue of the continent is based on Altmer speech and writing, and most of the Empire's arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from Altmer traditions. They normally have golden, green or brown eyes.

## Characteristics
The Altmer are known for being the direct descendants of the original elves, the **[Aldmer](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)**. They have a natural link to magic and the arcane arts in general, and are very competent mages. They're organized in a very perfectionist and rigorous society, and subjugate people that don't fit their expectations. They have a special relationship with the Eight due to being considered descendants from the Eight themselves, who they call the **[Aedra](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)** (meaning "ancestor" in **[Ehlnofex](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ehlnofex_Languages)** (or **[Aldmeris](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/hrafnirs-languages-nordic#Aldmeris)**), the original language of the Aldmer). Due to their heritage, Aldmer have bonuses in magic, and gain **+1 point** in Intelligence **or** Willpower. They gain **+2 points** to be used in Knowledges, the third Ability column. Note that it is not allowed to use both points in the same Ability, the player is required to spread them. They also earn **+1 point** in the Rituals background, as well as **+1 point** in some spell in the character's most prominent school of magic. They are naturally blessed by Anu, and get **+2 points** of Magicka in their sheet.
