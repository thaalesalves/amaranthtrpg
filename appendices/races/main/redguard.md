**[Redguards](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Redguard)** are the most naturally talented warriors in **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. The dark-skinned, wiry-haired people of **[Hammerfell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell)** seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank-and-file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many armor styles and weapons (particularly swords), Redguards are also physically blessed with hardy constitutions, resistance to poison, and quickness of foot. Unlike most other human races, they are not believed to have any connection with the ancestral **[Nordic](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** homeland of **[Atmora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Atmora)**.

## Characteristics
Redguards are known for their talent with sword and for their resilience. They developed a technique known as **[Sword-Singing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sword-singers)**, inherited from an ancient Order of warriors that followed the **Way of the Sword** in **[pre-Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Yokuda)** times, eternalized in Tamriel by **[Frandar Hunding](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Frandar_Hunding)**. They get **+1 point** in Endurance **or** Agility, and **+1 point** in a melee Ability from the first column. Due to their **[Ra Gada](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ra_Gada)** heritage, in case they're a **[Forebear](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Forebears)**, they get **+1 point** in Generation, and in case they're a **[Crown](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Crowns)**, they get **+1 point** in Mentor. They get **+1 point** in a spell from the Alteration school, and due to Hunding's teachings, they get **+1 die** in defense rolls with shields and in attack rolls in one-handed swords.
