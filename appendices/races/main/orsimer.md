**[Orcs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orc)**, also called **Orsimer** or **Pariah Folk** in ancient times, are the elves of the **[Wrothgarian Mountains](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Wrothgarian_Mountains)**, **[Dragontail Mountains](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragontail_Mountains)**, **[Valenwood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Valenwood)**, **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)** and **[Orsinium](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orsinium)** (literally translated as "Orc-Town"). They are noted for their unshakable courage in war and their unflinching endurance of hardships. Orcs have elven blood, but are usually considered to be both Beastfolk and Goblin-ken. In the past, Orcs were widely feared and hated by the other nations and races of **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)** and were seen as nothing more than uncivilized beasts, savage barbarians. The Orcs are as civilized as any of the other races, having worked hard to be seen as actual people. They have slowly won acceptance in the **[Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)**, in particular for their distinguished service in the **[Emperor's Legions](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion)**. Many Orcs in the **[Third Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Era)** have actually received an Imperial education as a benefit of serving the Imperial Legion. Orc armorers are prized for their craftsmanship, and Orc warriors in heavy armor are among the finest front-line troops in the Empire, and are fearsome when using their berserker rage.

## Characteristics
### City Orcs
Civilized orcs, born and raised in Orsinium or other larger cities, are less feared and more socially accepted. They're considered traitors by the tribal orcs, who live in the ways of **[Malacath](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Malacath)**. Some city Orcs refuse to follow Malacath, the Orsimeri main god and **[Daedric Prince](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes)** (Malacath is also known as **[Mauloch](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mauloch)** to some races such as the Nords, and is a corrupted version of the **[Aldmeri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** god **[Trinimac](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Trinimac)**). They get **+1 point** in Charisma **or** Intelligence, and their robust physique gives them **+1 point** in Heavy Armor **or** Two-Handed.

### Tribal Orcs
The traditional tribal Orcs, who live in forts scattered around the western and central **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. They're divided into clans, and follow the **[Daedric](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedra)** doctrines of their god, Malacath. They're known for being good warriors, having robust physiques, being strong as a hot temper. They get **+1 point** in Strength **or** Endurance, as well as **+1 point** in Heavy Armor **or** Two-Handed.

### Wood Orcs
Wood Orcs are a more isolated group of Orcs, that live around Valenwood. Similarly to their tribal counterparts, they're used to life in the wild and in dense forests. They claim to have lived in Valenwood since before the Aldmeri even left **[Aldmeris](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeris)**, which goes against the accepted origin of the Orsimer, that were "born" **during** the Chimeri exodus from **[Summerset](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Summerset_Isles)**. They're rival to the Bosmer, and are as good and agile as the former in the wild lifer. They get **+1 point** in Agility **or** Endurance, as well as **+1 point** in Athletics **or** Marksmanship.

### Iron Orcs
Iron Orcs are also isolated, and they live in the region of **[Craglorn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Craglorn)**, in the region of **[Hammerfell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell)**. They live in mines, and are very skilled in the art of smithing, as well as being very capable warriors. They're culturally separated from other variations of Orcs, and have their own language, which is different from **[Orcish](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orcish)**, the language spoken by Orcs. The origins of Iron Orcs is unknown, as they claim to have arrived in the region before the Aldmeri exodus from Summerset. They're known for taming dangerous animals, like **[Welwas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Welwa)** and **[Trolls](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Troll)**. They get **+1 point** in Strength **or** Endurance, as well as **+1 point** in Animal-ken **or** Smithing.
