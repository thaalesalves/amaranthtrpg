# Amaranth
The Amaranth is the Dreamer, the conductor of the current Universe where reality is inserted. Their way of seeing things, their ideas, their thoughts echo through reality and influence directly and indirectly everything that happens, even though one's individuality is still maintained. While you narrate your adventure, consider yourself Ald-Anu, the Amaranth of Tamriel-Actual, the one that came after Yokuda and before Akavir. The importance of the Amaranth in the Elder Scrolls lore is the namesake of this system, a custom adaptation of White Wolf's Storyteller, and implements games from the Elder Scrolls into a simple but fun TRPG based on d10.
