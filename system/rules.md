# System Rules

Amaranth has a set of rules that aim to make the game balanced and give some direction on how things should go. As any other RPG system, the rules are more of a framework to serve as a base to the game, but it's upÂ´to the Narrator to choose which mechanics will be used - and this may include the Narrator creating their own set of rules.
