# Merits
​
Merits are positive character traits that cost points to be used in the sheet. Merits vary from abilities to destiny.
​
## Mental
### Aptitude (1 pt.)
You are particularly gifted with one Ability. Perhaps you are a poet of great renown or a master fleshcrafter. Within your specific Aptitude, reduce all difficulties by 2. Characters may purchase this Merit more than once, but Storytellers should feel free to veto any Ability selections that seem too powerful or unbalanced, especially for combat Abilities.
​
### Acute senses (1 pt.)
One of your senses is exceptionally stronger than normal. Choose one: vision, audition, olfaction, gustation or tactition. You have a bonus die for every perception roll related to the sense you've chosen. This merit may be taken up to 5 times. One for each sense. When used in tandem with Auspex, the senses taken reach superhuman levels. Example: when used in tandem with Auspex, your sight becomes almost microscopic, and your tastebuds can detect minute differences in Parts per million. 

### No hangover (1 pt.)
You haven't drank all that much. Spend 2 points of Stamina to elminate your inebriation completely. Can only be used by Bosmer and Nord, unless the Narrator says otherwise.
​
### Ambidexterity (1 pt.)
Both of your hands function equally well, and as such you take no penalty for performing and dexterous movements or tasks with your "off" hand. You get an extra die for rolls with weapons that require Ambidexterity, such as dual wield.
​
### Feline equilibrium (1 pt.)
Your sense of equilibrium is just perfect. You walk on planks, ledges, wires or walls. You get an extra die on rolls where equilibrium is important.
​
### Code of honor (1 pt.)
You have a moral code of ethics that you follow to the T, that should be justified with the backstory. Even while in a frenzy you will still attempt to follow your code. You automatically resist any temptation to break your code. You get '''one''' re-test against supernatural or Daedric forces that use Social or Mental Attributes or Abilities that may try to force you to break or violate your code.

### Combat expertise (2 pt.)
Years of combat experience have given you a sixth sense that prevents you from commiting a - potentially fatal - mistake during combat. Once per session, you can do a single re-test in any test where you're directly attacking or being attacked by an opponent.

### Common sense (1 pt.)
You have a strong sense of intuition. If you're about to do something risky, you can directly ask the Narrator if you're doing the right thing or not. This quality is specially useful for starters in the Storyteller system or with the Elder Scrolls universe. When you use this merit, do let the Narrator know, otherwise they may refuse to give you advice.​

### Concentration (1 pt.)
Noises and interruptions do not bother you. You can't be penalized for distractions -- you are **always** focused.
​
### Danger sense (2 pt.)
You have a natural 6th sense when it comes to danger. You can execute actions with your normal initiative even when you've been surprised. This merit is more accurate and specific than Auspex, but the two can be used in tandem to create an even more powerful warning system.
​
### Audacity (3 pt.)
You have a knack, or even a gift, for doing risky actions. You get an extra die for actions that are especially dangerous (such as difficult combat challenges). Once per scene, you suffer a penalty for taking on these challenges, and may ask the Narrator to give you a less worse penalty.
​
### Favor (2 to 6 pt.)
You have done a very big favor for someone and now they owe you a boon. You may have gifted them with favors or material items sometime in the distant past, or even last week, but now they owe you a debt. This grants you an advantage in your dealings with this group or person (-1 to the difficulty level of any checks to influence them). Although you would not give up your current position lightly, you may also call in this debt (or debts) should you require aid. Such aid must be commensurate with the initial value of your gift of Prestation. The number of points in Favor must be determined by both the player and Storyteller, based on the number and magnitude of the debts owed you, and the importance of the group or person who owes them. The exact nature of this Merit should be worked into the elder character's journal or memoirs.
​
### Jack of all trades (5 pt.)
You have a vast pool of knowledge in many skills and knowledges. Obtained through extensive travel or simply the number of jobs you have held. You always seem to have the know how to get the job done. Even if you don't have the required Ability for a given action -- like Medicine to do first-aid, Alchemy to brew a potion of Academics to decipher the origins of something, you may always try. You don't get a re-test for this, but you can use two Magicka to avoid the negative outcome of the action.
​
### Lightning calculator (1 pt.)
You have the mathematical and statistical skills of the **[Grand Prognosticator](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:The_Grand_Prognosticator)**. You get an extra die in rolls that involve numeric abilities, and is also exceptionally good in evaluating probabilities. When you have sufficient information, you can ask the Narrator with some advance about the difficulty of the challenges in this action.
​
### Mechanical aptitude (2 pt.)
You have the mechanical skills of one of **[Sotha Sil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sotha_Sil)**'s **[Clockwork Apostles](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Clockwork_Apostles)**. You get 2 extra dice to understand, fix or operate any mechanical device.
​
### Natural linguist (2 pt.)
Languages come easy for you. You are able to speak the same amount of languages as your Linguistics Ability has in points. You have to write down which languages your character speaks so you can use them later.
​
### Inspiring (2 pt.)
You inspire those around you and help them make bigger efforts. You get two extra dice in Social tests to encourage, inspire or cause positive reactions in them. Once per scene you get a die for saying an inspiring thing.
​
### True love (1 pt.)
You have or may have lost a true love. They are a constant beacon of peace in your own little world of darkness, and to think of them or be near them is soothing. If you are ever near the edge, the thought of leaving your love behind is enough to push you to carry on and survive. If your love is still around, or is mortal, they may require baby steps, or the occasional rescue which can become dampening. This is a fun, but taxing merit. Do not take it lightly.
​
### Animal affinity (1 pt.)
The character has an innate understanding of and rapport with a certain type of animal. All difficulties dealing with that Animal are reduced by two.
​
### Dunmeri magnestism (1 pt.)
You have a certain _je ne sais quoi_... or maybe a _voulez-vous coucher avec moi_ would be a more fitting description? You get two extra dice when trying to attract or seduce others.
​
### Eidetic memory (2 pt.)
You have a memory so perfect it's like your brain has direct contact with Memory or the **[Dreamsleeve](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dreamsleeve)**. Just by quickly looking at something, that something will be engraved into your memory. In stressful situations such as combat, a Mental test of six dice will be required to memorize stuff.
​
### Gracefulness (2 pt.)
There's a natural grace to yourself. Your movements are hypnotizing, and your words enchant, even when they're harsh words. It's almost impossible for you to be looked at with disdain or disapproval, even when you mess everything up. People respect this talent, and even jealous people will admit you have style. The difficulty for Social tests is decreased by two whenever there's a chance of causing a good impression. This does not apply to brute force threats.
​
### Professional liar (2 pt.)
Lying is natural to you. Even the world's biggest lie sounds like some divine truth when it comes from your mouth. You get two extra dice in any Social test that involves lying or cheating.
​
### Maternal intuition (4 pt.)
You have the incredible ability of seeing the heart of the situation. All rolls of Intelligence have their difficulty decreased by one. Additionally, situations where three or more successes are required, you will need one fewer to succeed with the action.
​
## Physical
### Diverse fighting style (4 pt.)
Maybe you were a Sword-Singer in the past life, or maybe you were Hunding himself. You are an extremely challenging opponent in fights, and will not be penalized for using exotic or unfamiliar weapons, and also have the ability of detecting weak points in opponents, no matter which martial art or fighting style they use. As a result, you can detect these weak points with a Mental test of ten dice. This is a restrict merit and may only be used with plausible justification in the background story and if the Narrator approves.
​
### Double jointed (1 pt.)

​
### Dawnbreaker (1 pt.)

​
### Hypersensitive palate (2 pt.)

​
### Bruiser (4 pt.)
You are big. Very big, and possibly weight 200kg and are 2.20m tall. You instill discomfort and/or fear in those around you. Although this may not be entirely accurate, you do radiate a sort of dangerous aura, so much so that people will cross the street to avoid you. This merit allows you to use a two-handed weapon in a single hand.
​
### Natural swimmer (2 pt.)
You swim as if you were a fish. Are you related to the **[Sload](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sload)** or the **[Dreugh](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dreugh)**? Tests related to swimming have their difficulty decreased by two.
​
### Pain tolerance (2 pt.)
You have become used to pain, and it doesn't bother you anymore. You can ignore one die from wound penalties. When you're Hurt or Injured, you don't suffer penalties in your actions. You suffer only one die of penalty when you're Wounded or Mauled, and even Crippling injuries only give you a penalty of four dice instead of the usual five. You will still suffer from Incapacitation as usual.
​
## Supernatural
### Daedric sensor (4 pt.)
You have a supernatural ability for detecting Daedric presence wherever you are, even when there are hypnotization or illusion spells involved. You might have visions that may show important information about Daedric plans that may be used as clues for something important. You get two extra dice for Daedra detection.
​
### Oblivion respect (2 pt.)
Every time you visit a plane of Oblivion, you get the attention of its inhabitants, in a positive way. They will be curious about you, and this may be used for your advantage. Do take care, though, as if a Xivkyn or a Harvester takes interest in you, it could mean trouble.
​
### Greater good (1 pt.)
You have an objective greater than any other thing, that gives your life direction. You don't care much about minor, casual problems, since your greater objective is everything. You will sometimes act in a counter-intuitive manner thinking that is the best course of action to achieve your goal, but that could be good. You get two extra dice in every roll related to your greater objective. Choose a greater objective and get the Narrator's approval. If you already have the [Obsession](/rules/sheet/flaws#obsession) flaw, you may not have this merit.
​
### Mage companion (1 pt.)
The character is friends with someone who is a Mage. Although you may call on them any time you want, they might also need your help and you will need to go help them. This Mage is probably a student at the **[College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:College_of_Winterhold)** or the **[Arcane University](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Arcane_University)**, but they may be a practitioner of any school of magic, as long as this is justified.
​
### Magical resistance (2 pt.)

​
### Magic sensitivity (1 pt.)
You have the ability to detect if magic was used or is being used on a 5 meter radius around you.
​
### Sanctity (2 pt.)
This Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone considers the player pure and innocent, though not necessarily naïve. The player has a saint-like quality that is hard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. The player is trusted, even if they are not trustworthy. At the Storyteller's discretion, the players tend to receive lesser punishments for wrongdoing, and they are liked by most.

### Sanctuary (2 pt.)
Someone has promised protection when you need a place to stay. It may be a relative, a friend, an ally or a mentor, or even someone who owes you a boon. This person may protect you from harm.

### True faith (7 pt.)
You have been touched by the Eight and One, as has the favor of a specific god of your choosing. You need at least four points of Willpower to have this merit, and get an extra die in actions that involve praying for this god to help you, once per session. If the Narrator allows, you may roll 10 dice with the difficulty being chosen by the Narrator to execute actions that could be considered miracles.

### Daedric favor (2 to 5 pt.)
You've done something for a Daedra, and now they own you a debt. It is necessary to have at least four points of Intelligence and three in ability used to have the help of this Daedra. You may have the favor of a lesser Daedra, such as a Scamp, that give you 2 points in the ability used (as well as Intelligence), or a Dremora Churl, which may give you 3 points. The favor of a powerful Daedric mage gives you 4 points, and the favor of a Daedric Prince gives you 8 points. These actions must be approved by the Narrator.
