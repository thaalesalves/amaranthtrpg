# Restoration

Restoration is one of the six schools of magic, focused in curing, restoring and fortifying mind and body attributes, curing diseases and protecting oneself against evil influences. Despite the incredible utility of Restoration spells, knowledge about them seems have been a recent thing: until the Second Era, even cure spells were rare. Because of the benevolent nature of this school, it is specially popular between devouts.

* Cure and restoration spells increase the target's points after being reduced somehow. They're mostly used to restore health, but other attributes may also be affected.
* Fortification spells temporarily increase attributes such as strength, endurance or even magical abilities.
* Protection spells are used to annulate hostile magic received directly.
