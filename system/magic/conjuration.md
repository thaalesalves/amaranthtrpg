# Conjuration

Conjuration is the art of summoning creatures of items from other planes. It is one of the sext schools of magic, despite not being considered one of the Great Schools by the **[Mages' Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mages_Guild)**, only becoming of common use after the **[Warp in the West](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Warp_in_the_West)**. Despite that fact, it has been practiced for centuries by witch covens and mages around **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. Mages of the **[Direnni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Direnni)** clan were among the first to formalize the rituals, chants and enchantments used to open connections with the planes of **[Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Oblivion)**, many of these still being used.
