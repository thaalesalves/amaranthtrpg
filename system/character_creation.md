# Character Creation
Just like in the main games, the player needs a character to be able to play, and this character is created using a set of tools. This article is a set of guidelines to guide you through the creation of your character. Your character is defined in a _**[character sheet](/system/character_sheet)**_, with all attributes, abilities, details and information about them.

Like in **[TES games](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:The_Elder_Scrolls)**, a character needs a race. For the base mechanics of Amaranth, we have the same main 10 races as the main games, and each one of these races will have its own set of buffs, debuffs and abilities. The key to creating a character is to first think about what you would want in an adventurer. Create an idealization of your character, such as a general concept, and write it down in your sheet - that may be their profession or general description, i.e., a powerful sorcerer or a mighty warrior, or even a blacksmith or a carpenter.

Once the general concept of your character is set, you may proceed to the next steps. Do note that as this is a role-playing game, your character might grow or evolve with each one of their decisions, so the starting character may not be the same person as a future version of them - as characters are expected to grow mature with time and experience, just like real life.

In this guide, we will create Hjofring Stone-Bone as an example. For more details of each item contained in the character sheet, please refer to the **[main article](/system/character_sheet)**.

## Creating Hjofring Stone-Bone
Your first step in creating a character is picturing them in your mind. Just like in the electronic versions of The Elder Scrolls games, your character will be a compromise of what the system allows you to do and what you want to do. Try and think about the type of character you want to play. Once you have pictured their general appearance, maybe even their style, try and think about their personality. How they think, how they act, _how they think they act_ and _how they want to act_. Once you've figured that out, you're ready to move on to the first step of character creation.

### Choosing a concept
The concept of a character is a summarization of who they are. In other words, a "warrior", or a "mage". You even get more sophisticated and extravagant in your concept and make it more detailed, such as "arrogant warrior-poet" or "self-righteous diplomat". Let your imagination work.

Do mind the size of the field though. The character creation only allows so many characters to be written, so if your concept gets too big you might want to right it down somewhere else (or even create a custom character sheet of your own, if that's your thing).

When we think of Hjofring Stone-Bone, the name suggests a tank, someone strong, bulky, tough. We can start imagining what his temper and attitude will be like (this is an important step, once we get there). Let's go with "short-tempered tank" for Hjofring.

### [Choosing a race](/appendices/races)
Names are something very personal, and you're free to use the names you see fit for your characters. But when we speak of ethnicities within the Elder Scrolls Universe, there are some patterns that can be followed to help you through character creation. Just like in real life, different cultures and languages have different names. Sometimes they are completely different names, and sometimes they are translated versions of a name in a different language (i.e., Ioánnis (gre) -> Ioannes (lat) -> John (en) -> João (pt) -> Juan (es) -> Johann (de) etc.).

The name Hjofring suggests us our character is a Nord, or of **[Nord](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** ancestry - possibly hailing from **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)**. If we already have a more detailed background for the character we can go with that. Let's say that Hjofring is a Nord born in **[Eastmarch](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Eastmarch)**, more precisely in the town of **[Kynesgrove](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kynesgrove)**. Therefore, our character sheet will show him as a Nord.

**[Races](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Races)** in Amaranth go beyond just the name and the homeplace of a character, though. The race will determine the general appearance of the character, as well as give them some predefined attributes and statistics. Being a Nord, Hjofring will get extra points and dice in certain stats. He gets +1 point in a melee Talent, +1 point in a chosen background (we'll get there) and +1 point in Mentor or Generation. He also gets +1 point in a chosen frost spell from the Destruction school. Nords also have a special power called Ice Throat, and because of that Hjofring gets an additional die in attack or defense rolls that involve frost.

### [Choosing archetypes](/system/character_sheet/archetypes)
Archetypes will define how a character acts, and what they think of themselves. Put simply, a character's nature is their "great truth", what they believe within themself, and their demeanor reflects their external personality. These are double-faced, as they may negate each other depending on the character. Sometimes, we are not who we think we are.

Hjofring is a firm believer of **[Kyne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kyne)**, and follows her dogmas and way of life. He is short-tempered, but he thinks of himself as a rational and sensible person. He doesn't like it much when things don't go his way, but he is humble altogether and accepts that if something didn't happen as expected, it's because of the will of the Divines. But he always does what it takes to reach the goals that are set. He never stops, and gives his blood to make sure things end well. He might be a bit irrational and short-tempered, but he is not evil. He works hard and tries his best, always.

Given these info about him, we can say that his demeanor is Bravo, as he's a badass and tough, he respects power. At least this is the impression he gives people. We can say his nature is Hard Worker, as he does everything in his power to keep his loved ones and allies safe and comfortable. When everything fails, he will give himself for the sake of those who need.

### [Defining the attributes](/system/character_sheet/attributes)
Attributes are what make a character able to do what they can do. You can't use a sword properly if you don't have enough strength to raise it, can you? This is where Attributes come into play.

As we defined earlier, Hjofring is a strong tank. He needs to be able to take blows and stand his ground, so let's make his Attributes reflect that. There's a catch, though. We only have so many points to use in our attributes, so we need to use them wisely to keep our characters consistent and usable. The default approach of the system is by starting with 7, 5 and 3 points.

This means you can spend those points in different columns. That is, you choose one column to spend 7 points, a column to spend 5 points and then a third column to spend 3 points. This is to keep things balanced, so depending on your character's archetypes and concept, you need to choose one column to focus on. With Attributes, we have three columns: Physical, Social and Mental. If you need more details on what each of those are for, take a look at the main article for Attributes.

Hjofring is a strong tank and has a short temper, but he's still caring person even though he's not very bright. This gives us a general idea on which column to focus. It makes more sense to choose the Physical column to spend his first 7 points. Since he's big and bulky, he won't be very agile, but he will be strong and endurable. As a general rule (the Narrator has authority to change this rule), we don't usually put more than 4 points at first so our character doesn't get too overpowered in certain areas right in the beginning of the game. Let's put 3 points in Strength, 3 points in Endurance and 1 in Agility. This makes Hjofring a strong and endurable character.

Let's move on to the second column. Since we know he's humble but not very bright, we can safely choose the Social column to spend out 5 points on. Let's put 1 points in Charisma, as he's a generally nice person even though he loses it quite easily, which doesn't make him too charismatic. We can put 3 points in Manipulation, as he's big and strong and can easily intimidate and manipulate people using that trait in his favor. The remaining point goes to Luck.

The last column is about his wits. He's a well trained warrior, so he can be perceptive, but he's not very intelligent and doesn't have too much of a willpower. He lives through passion and emotion, so his willpower isn't very strong. As he's always focused on fighting, he's not very intelligent either. We can put all 3 points in Perception to make him a good warrior in battle, and this could also help him with tactics.

### [Defining the abilities](/system/character_sheet/abilities)
Now we get to the part that illustrates what Hjofring can actually do. What he can do and how well he does it, this all is done by using his Abilities. Again, we have 3 columns. One for Talents, one for Skills and one for Knowledges. Let's examine his character and personality and see what he's able of doing. Here, we have 13, 9 and 5 points, and these follow the same logic as the Attributes columns.

We've established he's a tank, so he knows his way around with a sword, but most importantly he knows how to defend himself and take a lot of blows. We can choose the Talents column for our 13 points and the Skills column for our 9 points. This will give us enough points and abilities to reflect what we've defined for him. Let's put 4 points in Heavy Armor, 3 points in Block, 3 points in Brawl and 3 points in Two-Handed. With this, we're done with Hjofring's Talents.

Hjofring knows how to block, how to wield heavy armor properly, how to melee fight and how to handle a two-handed weapon properly. Now, we have to choose which types of two-handed weapons he knows how to use, and we have 9 points for that. Let's make him equally good with Blades, Hammers and Axes, and give each 3 points.

Now we have 5 points to define his knowledges. He's trained in battle, so he knows one or two things about healing people. As he doesn't do well with magic, he will do it with Medicine. Let's give it 3 points. Doctors need medicine and concoctions to treat their patients, so he knows how to brew a few potions and such. We can give him 2 points in Alchemy then.

With this, we have defined how well Hjofring is able to do stuff, from fighting to treating wounds from battle. Let's move on to his advantages.

### [Merits](/system/character_sheet/merits) & **[Flaws](/system/character_sheet/flaws)**
Merits & Flaws add effects, buffs and/or debuffs to your character. A merit is a positive characteristic your character has that cost you points, while flaws are negative characteristics that will give you extra points that may be spent on other items. You may have as many of these as you want, unless your Narrator says otherwise. Some may be restricted by default so new characters don't use them, your Narrator may create custom ones and even block you from using default ones. Speak to your Narrator for more details.

You can choose these based on their effects and how they fit your character's personality. There are many options to choose from, and more may be added to the system over time. By default, we have 15 points to spend on these. These are called freebie points, and they may be used to buy merits for your character or converted into points to use in other parts of your sheet (check the exchange rate).

We've defined that Hjofring is a caring but tough person. We need to reflect that with his merits and flaws. Let's start with his merits. We can say he has an Aptitude (1 pt.) in Block (as he's a tank), that he is Ambidextrous (1 pt.) since he uses both his hands to fight, that he follows a specific Code of Honor (1 pt.) as we mentioned that he's a hardcore follower of **[Kyne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kyne)**, and that he is also a trained warrior with Combat Expertise (2 pt.), and for the same reason we know that he may use Diverse Fighting Styles (4 pt.) and that his is a Bruiser (4 pt.). To sustain damage taken, he has a Pain Tolerance (2 pt.) that allows him to take blows without major problems. We're done with his merits, and we used all of his 15 points in the process. We may start with flaws now, which will give us more points to use for other things.

Underneath his tough skin lies a Soft Hearted (1 pt.). Although he's caring, he's Arrogant (1 pt.) in his strength, and might think he's more than he actually is, which will eventually put him (and possibly everyone around him) in danger. We can make things a bit hard for him, and give him Myopia (3 pt.), so he may have some difficulty seeing things in a mid to far distance from him. We can say that he has been Unlucky (7 pt.) during his life, which all increase the difficulty in his rolls by 2 and make him take more damage from enemies. We've given him enough flaws, and now we have 12 points that we may use to add more merits or convert into ability, spell or attribute points.

### [Choosing backgrounds](/system/character_sheet/backgrounds)
Backgrounds are character traits and details that support their backstory to make it more complete. It may vary from friends that will help you in times of need to an allowance that their parents give them. Let's define a simple backstory for Hjofring and give him backgrounds that support that story. By default, we're allowed to spend 5 points in backgrounds, and this may be one single background with five points, or five different backgrounds. You're allowed to choose these as you please given that you have enough points to do what you want.

He's a trained soldier, well disciplined that has had a lot of combat experience. We can see that at a given point in his life, he served the Skyrim Army, a Guard corporation or even the **[Imperial Legion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion)**. Let's establish that he was once a Legionary. Hjofring served the Legion for years and went up to the rank of **[Quaestor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion#Lower_Ranks)**. He has good Allies in the Legion, but nothing too big. His allies aren't too powerful within the Legion or the region, but they are people Hjofring can trust. Let's spend 2 points in the Allies background, which gives him allies with little or weak power. As he's a soldier, he will have weapons he can use, so let's give him 3 points of Arsenal, which gives him a few daggers made of steel and a few swords made of iron or bronze.

We've spent all 5 points Hjofring has. But remember we had some freebie points to use from when we chose his flaws? We may spend another 12 points in backgrounds, as per the conversion table each background costs 1 freebie point.

Let's not make him too overpowered, but we may say that he had a good Mentor in the Legion, and give him 4 points in this background. Let's say that a **[Knight Protector](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion#Imperial_Legion_Knight_Ranks)** of the Legion called Iulius Quintius was his mentor and trained him during his times in the army. He has a moderate influence over the Legion he's part of, as he's the commander of a small platoon that is part of a larger Legion, and his Legate trusts him as well. This gives Hjofring a relatively powerful ally that will help him in times of need.

We still have 8 points to spend. Given that he has a good contact within the army, and has served for a few years, we can modify the initial value of Arsenal, and raise it to 4 points, which will give him access to swords crafted with steel as well, so he has better weapons to use in battle. As a former Quaestor of the Imperial Legion, we can say he has 3 points of Status, which gives him some influence in the region. With the 4 remaining points, we can give him a better Ally by raising it to 4, and spend the 2 remaining points in Resources, which will give him some monthly gold for him to spend.

### [Adding spells](/system/rules/magic)
If we were to create a mage here, we could have focused the remaining points on getting Hjofring some spells, but since he's supposed to be a fierce warrior, let's give him simpler spells that he may have learned to use while in the Legion. Let's say that during his time fighting in **[Titus Mede](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:People_T#Titus_Mede)**'s army for the **[Ruby Throne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:White-Gold_Tower)** in **[4E 17](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Era#First_Century)** some of the **[Colovian](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Colovia)** battlemages taught him some basic spells that could help him in war. Starting characters are allow to spend 3 points with spells during character creation, or consult the conversion table to use freebies to buy spells.

He learned one basic spell (see the Spells page for the ones available, or consult your Narrator about creating your own): Quick Cure. Let's spend all 3 points here. Although it may look like he'll always do well with this, don't forget he's not prominent with magic: he has no points spent on the other items, so he'll always have only these 3 dice.

### Finishing up
Hjofring is basically created. We still need to determine his Stamina and Magicka pool, but that's simple. Magicka is determined by the sum of your character's Willpower  (Attribute) and Magic (Ability) points, and Stamina is determined by adding his Strength (Attribute) to his Endurance (Attribute).

With this, we're done creating the character. There are other fields and tables in the sheet that will be populated with time, as you play. The Notes space is meat for you to write bits of information you get through the gameplay. But given that the amount of space there is very limited, it is common for players to write stuff in the back of the sheet or use a separate notebook.

As for the Experience table, that's what you get as you play. Your Narrator will give exp points to the players, and the players may use these points to improve their characters, using them with the same conversion table as freebies. 

As with the World of Darkness games, Derangements are diseases, illnesses, curses and vices that characters may acquire as they live. These are not "buyable", and they will be given as you play. Since Humanity isn't a thing in Amaranth, these will be given out as things happen in their life: for example, if you fight a **[vampire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vampire)** that's too powerful, it's possible that you may acquire **[Sanguinare Vampiris](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Disease#Sanguinare_Vampiris)**, **[Porphyric Hemophilia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Disease#Porphyric_Hemophilia)** or **[Noxiphilic Sanguivoria](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Disease#Noxiphilic_Sanguivoria)**, depending on the type of vampire. After a few days, the effects of these diseases is converted into a bigger Derangement: **[Vampirism](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vampirism)**. Consult with your Narrator for more details on how they will work with these during gameplay.

Combat, Armor and Artifacts are more specific. You may either describe items you have in your story by speaking to your Narrator (some Narrators don't allow players to start with custom equipment, so do speak to them before giving your character items). The Narrator may want you to spend points on some of the items, so before adding anything speak to them. 

Artifacts vary from family heirlooms to Daedric artifacts, and will either be acquired during gameplay of if the Narrator allows you to give it to your character.
