# Character Creation
Just like in the main games, the player needs a character to be able to play. The character has some limitations, as they need to fit the general model of the game. Like the electronic games, there is a set of tools available for characters to be created, and this needs to be followed in order to have a solid and good character. Your character is defined in a _**[character sheet](/system/character_sheet)**_, with all attributes, abilities, details and information about them.

Like in TES games, a character needs a race. For the base mechanics of Amaranth, we have the same main 10 races as the main games, and each one of these races will have its own set of buffs, debuffs and abilities. The key to creating a character is to first think about what you would want in an adventurer. Create an idealization of your character, such as a general concept, and write it down in your sheet - that may be their profession or general description, i.e., a powerful sorcerer or a mighty warrior, or even a blacksmith or a carpenter.

Once the general concept of your character is set, you may proceed to the next steps. Do not that as this is a role-playing game, your character might grow or evolve with each one of their decisions, so the starting character may not be the same person as a future version of them - as characters are expected to grow mature with time and experience, just like real life.

In this guide, we will create Hjofring Stone-Bone as an example. For more details of each item contained in the character sheet, please refer to the **[main article](/system/character_sheet)**.
