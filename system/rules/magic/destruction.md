# Destruction

The school of Destruction is one of the six schools of magic. It's about dealing damage to all sorts of matter, both organic and inorganic. Mastery of Destruction magic brings a certain amount of danger. The school of Destruction is divided into four basic types: elemental damage, drainage damage, direct damage, disintegration damage and vulnerability.

Elemental damage uses fire, frost, electricity or (rarely) poison to cause direct damage. It may used directly against targets, but some applications of this type of damage can be done through runes, cloaks or even damage walls to keep enemies at bay. Drainage damage attack the opponent's body by reducing temporarily one of their fundamental stats. Direct damage works similarly to drainage damage, but the damage is immediate e doesn't linger. Vulnerability spells make the target more susceptible to other types of damage, including  but not limited to weapon, poison and magic damage. Disintegration damage can only be used in equipment: weapons and armor. However, some skilled mages have been able to disintegrate entire bodies with their destruction magic mastery, using electricity.
