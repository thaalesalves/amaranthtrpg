# Mysticism

Mysticism is one of the six colleges of magic, and the one least understood by the magical community. The art has been described as allowing a mage "to alter the nature of magic itself" and as involving "the manipulation of magical forces and boundaries to bypass the structures and limitations of the physical world." The spells in the school have their origins with the Psijic Order of Artaeum, who call their study the "Old Way", and the school has occasionally been referred to as the Way of the Psijic. The practice of Mysticism seems to require dealing with "conundrums and paradoxes" and abandoning logic to "embrace a temporary sort of insanity" which may lead the student to long-term harm if practiced without proper instruction. Its usage was common among the mystic Reachman shamans during the Second Era. The spells are divided into five categories: transport, detection, absorption, reflection and manipulation of magical forces. The latter includes Dissipation, Soul Trap and Telekinesis. Absorption effects may be considered part of the Restoration school by some.

* Transport effects are used in places with road networks that are hard to travel by horse. They allow the caster to go to a specific location, or instantly appear in a place of power, like a chapel.
* A variation of detection spells also exists. These allow the caster to see the location of living beings, objects or any other item for which the spell was developed.
* Absorption effects allow the caster to directly drain energy from the target to themself. The spell may have as target their attributes, abilities, health, magicka or any other vital aspect of the target.
* Telekinesis is the ability of moving items without physically touching them.
* Soul Trap is the most controversial of all. Allows the caster to imprison the soul of a target into a gem, and uses it to create or recharge magical artifacts. Souls are divided between "white" - the soul of most creatures, and "black" - souls of advanced beings that are related to Creation, such as humans, elves (people in general, of all races), sentient Daedra and more.
