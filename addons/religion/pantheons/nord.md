# Nordic Pantheon

## The Children of the Sky
The **[Nords](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** are considered to be a devout people with grim religious beliefs. Among other things, they have long believed that **[Alduin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alduin)**, the World-Eater, would eventually return and bring about the end of the world. As dark as their belief systems are viewed to be, all Nordic traditions extend one bright, shining hope for Nords: **[Sovngarde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sovngarde)**, the Hall of Valor, where Nords who have proven their mettle in battle or died valiantly are welcome to experience euphoric bliss and camaraderie, free from time and boredom. Some stories claim the place was built by, and still inhabited by, the elusive **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)**. It is little surprise that cowardice is the worst trait a Nord can exhibit, for *"a Nord is judged not by the manner in which he lived, but the manner in which he died"*. Nords cross the whalebone bridge to reach Sovngarde, and flying whales are a cultural metaphor for the transition from **[Nirn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nirn)** to **[Aetherius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aetherius)**.

The **[Nordic Pantheon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord#The_Nordic_Pantheon)** is the group of gods worshipped originally by the **[Nords](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** before the implementation of the **[Imperial Cult](/addons/religion/imperial)**. It was worshipped by the old Nords of Atmora, and also by the Nedes, and had strong influence over the creation of the  **[Imperial Pantheon](/addons/religion/imperial)** by **[Saint Alessia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia)**, mixing concepts of Aldmeri and Nordic gods to create the Pantheon of the Eight Divines. It has been at a loss of followers for the last few millennia, despite still having strong influence over the culture and history of the Nords.

### Alduin
**[Alduin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alduin)** is the Nord variation of **[Akatosh](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akatosh)**. He only superficially resembles his counterpart in the **[Imperial Eight Divines](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divines)**. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, "the World Eater," comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that **[destroyed the last world to begin this one](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/fight-one-eating-birth-dagon)**. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nord pantheon but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.
Alduin destroyed the last world to enable the creation of this one, and he will destroy this one to enable the next. Alduin was once worshiped by the long-dead **[Dragon Cult](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Cult)**, but that has been outlawed for centuries, so Alduin has no admitted worshipers.

### Shor
The Nord version of **[Lorkhan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lorkhan)**, **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)** allied with **[Men](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Men)** after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (that is, **[Elven](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mer)** ones) conspired against him and brought about his defeat, dooming him to the afterlife, **[Sovngarde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sovngarde)**. **[Atmoran](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Atmora)** myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who led the Nords to victory over their **[Aldmeri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. Considered a "dead god," Shor has no priesthood and is not actively worshiped, but he is frequently sworn by.

### Orkey
God of mortality, **[Orkey](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orkey)** combines aspects of **[Mauloch](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mauloch)** and **[Arkay](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Arkay)**. He is a "loan-god" for the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during **[Aldmeri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** rule of **[Atmora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Atmora)**. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that "bound them to the count of winters." At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Then Shor showed up and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.

### Jhunal
**[Jhunal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jhunal)**, also known as the **Rune God** is the Nordic god of hermetic orders, knowledge and wisdom, represented by an owl. After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became **[Julianos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Julianos)** of the **[Divines](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divines)**. He is largely absent in modern **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)** mythology. Although worship of Jhunal has waned with most Nords, there are still those who have not forgotten him and aim for a higher purpose than the brandishing of swords and pursue things such as scholarship, history, reading, and invention. Certain Nord warriors also respect Jhunal as they must also have a strong mind and the knowledge to carry them through battle.

### Kyne
**[Kyne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kyne)**, or **Kaan** in the **[dragon language](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/lang-dragon)**, is the Nordic goddess of the Storm, widow of **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)**, the Blessed Warrior-Wife, and a favored god of warriors. She is one of the Hearth Gods, and is considered the chief deity of the Nordic pantheon. As the goddess of the Storm, she is strongly associated with wind and rain, and is thought to control both forces, even when they bring misery. She is often called the Mother of Men and beasts, as Nords believe the sky exhaled onto the land at the Throat of the World to form them. She is also called the "Kiss at the End", because Nords generally believe that she leads their dead to **[Sovngarde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sovngarde)**.
* **Main temple:** High Hrothgar (**[Throat of the World](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Throat_of_the_World)**, **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)**)

### Mara
For the Nords, **[Mara](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mara)** is a handmaiden of **[Kyne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kyne)** and concubine of **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)**. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, she's sometimes associated with **[Nir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nir)** of the "**[Anuad](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu)**," the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. The Divine is also worshipped as a member of the Nordic pantheon. In the Second Era, Mara was associated with the Ice Wolves that inhabited the mouth of the White River in the northeast of the province. Worship of Mara in the province of Skyrim was widespread in the Fourth Era and shrines dedicated to the Divine could be found both in the wilderness and in urban centers, such as at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude, and at the Temple of Mara in **[Riften](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Riften)**. A pond in the hold of Eastmarch was named after Mara. Some argued the return of the dragons in 4E 201 was a sign from Mara signalling her displeasure with the people of Skyrim.
* **Main temple:** Temple of Mara (**[Riften](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Riften)**, **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)**)

### Stuhn
**[Stuhn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Stuhn)** is the Nord precursor to **[Stendarr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Stendarr)**, brother of **[Tsun](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tsun)**, shield-thane of **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)**. Stuhn was a warrior god who fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take (and the benefits of taking) prisoners of war. Stuhn is the Nordic **God of Ransom, Fraternity, and Justice**, and is represented by a whale.

### Tsun
**[Tsun](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tsun)** is the Nordic god of **trials against adversity**. He died defending **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)** from foreign gods, with his death remembered as bringing about the current world. Tsun and his brother Stuhn were both Shield-thanes of Shor. He currently guards the Whalebone Bridge to the Hall of Valor of **[Sovngarde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sovngarde)**. At Shor's bidding, he has taken on the role of the master of trials, asking new arrivals to the utopia to prove their strength in combat against him before they can enter the Hall, where he fights using his axe. The Bear was also one of the ancient Atmoran animal tokens, associated later with the Nord god Tsun.
