# Imperial Pantheon

## The Eight
The **[Divines](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divines)** are the Aedric deities that form the **[Empire](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)**'s official pantheon, and are worshipped throughout all of **[Tamriel](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. Their positions in the pantheon were defined by **[Saint Alessia](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia)** during the foundation of the First Empire, as a result of the rebellion led by her. Her newly emancipated people had adopted the **[Aldmeri](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** religion long ago from their former masters, the **[Ayleids](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ayleid)**, but the rebellion was only succesfull because of the help from the armirs of **[Skyrim](https://esp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)**, who worshipped the **[Nordic Pantheon](/addons/religion/pantheons/nord)**. Alessian couldn't force one or the other group to worship one or the other pantheon, in order to avoid yet another war that could potentially collapse the just-founded Empire. She, then, developed an elegant synthesis of both traditions, combining common archetypes (mother-goddess, god of death, etc.), and avoiding drastic changes. This new pantheon became known as the Eight Divines, commonly known as the Eight.

### Akatosh
The **[Dragon God of Time](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akatosh)** is the chief deity of the Imperial Pantheon, and has different interpretations in the other pantheons of Tamriel. He represents resistance, invencibility and lasting legitimacy. According to the **[Monomyth](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Monomyth)** and the **[Anuad](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad)**, Akatosh was the first **[et'Ada](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gods)** to take form, and the other spirits followed him, creating the Linear Time, and, with it, the **[Aurbis](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aurbis)**.
* **Main temple:** The Great Chapel of Akatosh in **[Kvatch](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kvatch)** (**[Cyrodiil](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil)**)

#### Blessings
* **Basic:** Akatosh blesses his followers by expanding their Magicka (recharge of 5 points of Magicka per turn in combat) and their Agility (1 extra die in actions that use this Attribute);

* **Sect:** During the **[First Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:First_Era)**, the **[Alessian Order](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessian_Order)** ran a big witchhunt against anyone that didn't worship Akatosh and only Akatosh. Due to their unshakable faith, members of the Alessian Order magic rolls have their critical failures converted into successes, but all the tests for racial and religious situations will have their difficulty raised to 10.

### Arkay
**[Arkay](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Arkay)**, the Lord of the Wheel of Life, is one of the Divines and a very popular god in other territories as well. Arkay is more important in cultures where his father, Akatosh, is less related to Time, or where Akatosh's aspects of Time are less comprehensible to the layman. He's the god of funerals and burials, and is normally related to cyclical occasions, such as the cycle of life and death. His priests actively oppose necromancy and all forms of unlife, and any incorrect or immoral use of a mortal soul. Therefore, any person that died and went through through the correct rituals with a Priest of Arkay is protected by Arkay's Law, and cannot be reanimated. Necromancers have Arkay as their archenemy, and don't save efforts to mine his cult throughout Tamriel. Due to his association with the protection of mortality, he's known as the God of Mortals. Arkay is also known for having ascended to godhood after being infected with a deadly and incurable plague, and transformed into a god by **[Mara](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mara)**.
* **Main temple:** The Great Chapel of Arkay (**[Cheydinhal](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cheydinhal)**, **[Cyrodiil](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil)**)

She is also known as the Lady of Art and Music, or Queen of Heaven. Dibella is beauty incarnated, and her followers spread beauty through harmony, both from charm and grace. She teaches that mortals should give themselves to Love, and says that they should open their hearts to "the secrets of art and leave, and the treasures of friendship". Dibella doesn't impose a limit to the number of lovers one can have, but demands that the essence of love should be about quality, and not quantity.

Mara is considered a near universal deity as the Divine is featured in the pantheons of all the races of the continent of Tamriel save the Dunmer and Argonians. Saint Alessia consulted with Mara during her slave revolt against the Ayleid in the First Era. The **[Warp in the West](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Warp_in_the_West)**, also known as the Peace Miracle, that occured in 3E 417, is said to be the work of Mara, Akatosh and Stendarr.

His followers say that, despite his mysterious origins, Zenithar is the god that "will always win".

## The One
The Pantheon of the Eight would live on for thousands of years, until the unification of Tamriel by Tiber Septim and the start of the **[Third Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Era)**. In his deathbed, his deeds were so well known that he achieved godhood, making him one of the Divines. Known as Talos, the transcended Emperor was given a position between the gods, that now counted Nine (or, more traditionally, the Eight and One). Talos became the patron of the Empire and all of its ideals of civilization, as well as those who go to war to defend it. 

### Talos
**[Talos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Talos)**, Heir to the Seat of Sundered Kings, is the most important hero-god of Mankind. In his mortal form, known as Tiber Septim, he conquered all of Tamriel and ushered in the **[Third Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Era)** (and the **[Third Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Third_Empire)**). After death, his spirit ascended to the heavens to become the ninth and youngest divine, under the name given to him by the Nords: Talos. Also called Ysmir, "Dragon of the North". Less prominent sects, such as the Talos Cult, have been inspired by his apotheosis. In the **[Fourth Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Era)**, worship of Talos was banned as a result of the White-Gold Concordat. However, many of the Nords of Skyrim continued to revere him despite these strict terms. His aspect Ysmir, "Dragon of the North" is invoked as the patron to questing heroes.
* **Main temple:** (before the Great War) The Great Chapel of Talos (**[Bruma](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bruma)**, **[Cyrodiil](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil)**) - (after the Great War) Temple of Talos (**[Windhelm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Windhelm)**, **[Skyrim](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)**)
