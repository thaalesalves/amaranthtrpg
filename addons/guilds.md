# Guilds
Tamriel has a lot of guilds scattered around, each one with its own focus. There are guilds for adventurers, mages, warriors and whatnot. They will provide adventures and missions for their members, and sometimes that can even be used to make a solid living. Some guilds are known for their honor and service to the people, while others are known for causing problems. Each guild has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and characters will be allowed to join them.
