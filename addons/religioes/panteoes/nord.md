# Panteão Nórdico
O Panteão Nórdico é o grupo de deuses cultuado originalmente pelos **[Nords](https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** antes da normalização do culto Imperial. Foi cultuado pelos antigos Nords de Atmora, e também pelos antigos Nedes, e teve forte influência na criação do **[Panteão Imperial](/addons/religioes/panteoes/imperial)** pela Santa Alessia, misturando conceitos dos deuses Aldmeri com os deuses Nórdicos para criar o Panteão dos Oito. Tem perdido fieis nos últimos milênios, apesar de ainda ter forte influência na cultura e na história Nórdica e ter fieis espalhados por Arcéu até os dias modernos.

### Alduin
Alduin is the Nord variation of Akatosh. He only superficially resembles his counterpart in the Imperial Eight Divines. For example, Alduin's sobriquet, "the World Eater," comes from myths that depict him as the horrible, ravaging firestorm that destroyed the last world to begin this one. Nords therefore see the god of time as both creator and harbinger of the apocalypse. He is not the chief of the Nord pantheon (in fact, this pantheon has no chief; see "Shor") but its wellspring, albeit a grim and frightening one.
Alduin destroyed the last world to enable the creation of this one, and he will destroy this one to enable the next. Alduin was once worshiped by the long-dead Dragon Cult, but that has been outlawed for centuries, so Alduin has no admitted worshipers.

### Shor
The Nord version of Lorkhan, Shor allied with Men after the creation of the world. Foreign gods (that is, Elven ones) conspired against him and brought about his defeat, dooming him to the afterlife, Sovngarde. Atmoran myths depict him as a bloodthirsty warrior king who led the Nords to victory over their Aldmeri oppressors time and again. Before his doom, Shor was the chief of the gods. He is sometimes called the Children's God (see "Orkey.") Considered a "dead god," Shor has no priesthood and is not actively worshiped, but he is frequently sworn by.

Lorkhan, the Missing God, is the Creator-Trickster-Tester deity present in every Tamrielic mythic tradition.[1] He is known as the Spirit of Nirn, the god of all mortals.[2] His most popular name is the Elven variant Lorkhan, or Doom Drum,[1] which sometimes appears as LKHAN.[3][4] Names for versions or aspects of Lorkhan include Lorkhaj (the Moon Beast) in Elsweyr, Sep in Hammerfell, Sheor in High Rock, Shor in Skyrim, and Shezarr in Cyrodiil.[1][5][6][7] He convinced or contrived the Original Spirits (et'Ada) to bring about the creation of the Mundus, upsetting the status quo—much like his (figurative) father Padomay is usually credited for introducing instability, and hence possibility for creation, into the undivided universe (or the Beginning Place).[1][6][8]

After the world materialized, myths hold that Lorkhan was killed, mutilated, or at least separated from his divine center, the Heart of Lorkhan (known as Sep's "hunger" to the Redguards and Shor's Heart to the Nords), in an event sometimes called the shattering of Lorkhan.[1][6][9] This separation, which purportedly took place in Tamriel,[10] is typically called a punishment, but stories often suggest Lorkhan submitted to it voluntarily.[1][11] Whatever remained of Lorkhan afterward was exiled to wander through creation.[1][8][12] As the impetus for creating the Mundus, Lorkhan is at the center of the great ideological schism between the Elven and human perspectives on the event, which is known as the Sundering to Elves, and thus opinions of him vary dramatically in Tamriel.[1]

### Orkey
God of mortality, Orkey combines aspects of Mauloch and Arkay. He is a "loan-god" for the Nords, who seem to have taken up his worship during Aldmeri rule of Atmora. Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that "bound them to the count of winters." At one time, legends say, Nords only had a lifespan of six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Then Shor showed up and, through unknown means, removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.

According to Imperial scholars, the Nords believe they once lived as long as Elves until Orkey appeared; through heathen trickery, he fooled them into a bargain that "bound them to the count of winters", and the Nordic lifespan was reduced to six years due to Orkey's foul magic. Through unknown means, Shor showed up and removed the curse, throwing most of it onto the nearby Orcs.[2]

Nordic legend goes into greater detail with the story of Orkey and clarifies some of the details. Their stories claim that Orkey had long plagued them, and had stolen their years away while they were still in Atmora in the Merethic Era. During the reign of High King Wulfharth in the First Era, Orkey summoned Alduin, and nearly every Nord was "eaten down" to six years old by the Time-Eater. King Wulfharth, who had become a boy, pleaded to Shor for help. Shor's own ghost then fought Alduin on the spirit plane, as he did at the beginning of time, and he won, and Orkey's folk, the Orcs, were ruined. It was by watching this battle in the sky that Wulfharth learned how to use the thu'um to save his people. His effort, while successful, cost him his life.[3]

### Jhunal
God of knowledge and hermetic orders, precursor of Julianos. Never very popular among the mercurial and warlike Nords, his worship is fading.

Jhunal, also known as Jhunal the Rune God is the Nordic god of hermetic orders, knowledge and wisdom, represented by an owl.[1] After falling out of favor with the rest of that pantheon, he became Julianos of the Nine Divines. He is largely absent in modern Skyrim mythology.[2]

Wise-Wing the Owl is associated in northern Tamriel with Jhunal, and is said to warn the unwary away from graveyards and witches' covens during the New Life Festival.[3] Vivec mentioned "JHUNAL" as one of the eight known worlds.[4]

Although worship of Jhunal has waned with most Nords, there are still those who have not forgotten him and aim for a higher purpose than the brandishing of swords and pursue things such as scholarship, history, reading, and invention. Certain Nord warriors also respect Jhunal as they must also have a strong mind and the knowledge to carry them through battle.[5]

### Kyne
Nord Goddess of the Storm. Widow of Shor and favored god of warriors, she is often called the Mother of Men. Her daughters taught the first Nords the use of the Thu'um or "Storm Voice."

Kyne, or Kaan in the dragon language, is the Nordic goddess of the Storm, widow of Shor, the Blessed Warrior-Wife,[1]:354 and a favored god of warriors.[2][3] She is one of the Hearth Gods, and is considered the chief deity of the Nordic pantheon.[4] As the goddess of the Storm, she is strongly associated with wind and rain, and is thought to control both forces, even when they bring misery.[5][6] She is often called the Mother of Men and beasts,[7][1]:354 as Nords believe the sky exhaled onto the land at the Throat of the World to form them.[2][3][8][9] She is also called the "Kiss at the End", because Nords generally believe that she leads their dead to Sovngarde.[10]

Nords still refer to themselves as "the Sons and Daughters of Kyne".[11] Some consider her to be the leader of the Nordic pantheon of Divines.[10] Kyne and Kynareth are considered by followers of the Nine Divines to be one and the same, though more ardent supporters of the Old Ways among the Nords dismiss Kynareth as a "pale shadow".[3] While Nords also acknowledge Mara, the "Mother-Goddess" of the Empire, they view her only as Kyne's handmaiden.[2] The trees near Kynesgrove (or Kyne's Grove) are thought to be sacred to her.[12] Hela, a friend to all beasts and servant of Kyne, found eternal rest in the Forest of Dreams.[13]

### Mara
For the Nords, Mara is a handmaiden of Kyne and concubine of Shor. As the goddess of fertility and agriculture, she's sometimes associated with Nir of the "Anuad," the female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation.

The Divine is also worshipped as a member of the Nordic pantheon.[8] In the Second Era, Mara was associated with the Ice Wolves that inhabited the mouth of the White River in the northeast of the province.[30] Worship of Mara in the province of Skyrim was widespread in the Fourth Era and shrines dedicated to the Divine could be found both in the wilderness and in urban centers, such as at the Temple of the Divines in Solitude, and at the Temple of Mara in Riften.[23] A pond in the hold of Eastmarch was named after Mara.[23] Some argued the return of the dragons in 4E 201 was a sign from Mara signalling her displeasure with the people of Skyrim.[45]

### Stuhn
Nord precursor to Stendarr, brother of Tsun, shield-thane of Shor. Stuhn was a warrior god who fought against the Aldmeri pantheon. He showed Men how to take (and the benefits of taking) prisoners of war. 

Stuhn is the Nordic God of Ransom, Fraternity, and Justice, and is represented by a whale. He is the brother of Tsun and the shield-thane of Shor and is one of the Hearth Gods. Stuhn fought against the Aldmeri pantheon and showed Men how to take, and the benefits of taking, prisoners of war.

He is seen as a precursor to Stendarr by some and seen as the same as Stendarr by others.[1][2] His teachings are paired up with those of Jhunal.[3]

### Tsun
Tsun is the Nordic god of trials against adversity. He died defending Shor from foreign gods,[1] with his death remembered as bringing about the current world.[2] Tsun and his brother Stuhn were both Shield-thanes of Shor.[1][3] He currently guards the Whalebone Bridge to the Hall of Valor of Sovngarde.[4]:631 At Shor's bidding, he has taken on the role of the master of trials, asking new arrivals to the utopia to prove their strength in combat against him before they can enter the Hall, where he fights using his axe.[3][5][6] The Bear was also one of the ancient Atmoran animal tokens, associated later with the Nord god Tsun.[2][7]

Tsun held great respect for magic, which he called the "Clever Craft", and wielded the power of the Voice. He and others desired to face Alduin when the Time-Eater set his soul-snare in Sovngarde, but for reasons unknown, Shor held them back,[3] though Alduin's grip on Sovngarde eventually was broken by the Last Dragonborn.[6] Only Tsun can transport the living from Sovngarde by summoning Shor’s Might to return them to the Throat of the World.[4]
