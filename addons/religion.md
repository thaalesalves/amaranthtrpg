# Religion
There are many religions scattered through Tamriel. Many have their own gods, and many have different interpretations of the same gods, or the same aspects. Most religions derive from ancient Aldmeri gods, such as Auri-El or Trinimac, with different interpretations of those, such as Alduin, Akatosh and Alkosh, the three being different interpretations of the elven Auri-El (nordic, imperial and khajiiti respectively). Each religion has its own set of gods (or a single god in some cases), and each one of those gods has a different blessing with their own set of buffs and debuffs. A person, even though they follow a pantheon, will usually worship one specific god more than others - like how some Nords focus on either Shor or Kyne when they pray, or how some Imperials will cry for Stendarr for his Mercy.
