The **[Nords](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)** are the **children of the sky**, a race of tall and fair-haired humans from **[Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim)** who are known for their incredible resistance to cold and magical frost. They are fierce, strong and enthusiastic warriors, and many become renowned warriors, soldiers and mercenaries all over **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare, and are known as a militant people by their neighbors. Nords were known for a time for their nautical prowess when they migrated from Atmora. Seafaring merchants or smugglers are not unheard of, and they may be found in most coasts in Tamriel.

## Characteristics
Nords are known for being resilient and strong, good soldiers and loyal to governments that respect them, as they were loyal to the Empire for centuries, until the events of the **[Great War](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Great_War)** (**[4E 175](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fourth_Era)**), that ended with the basnishment of the Talos cult, thus causing a rebellion from the Nords against the **[Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)** (4E 201). Due to their strength and resilience, Nords get **+1 point** in Strength **or** Endurance. They also get **+1 point** in a melee Talent (the first Ability column). Due to being the children of **[Kyne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kyne)** and **[Shor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shor)**, and the first humans to settle **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**, they get **+1 point** in a chosen background. They get **+1 point** in Mentor **or** Generation. Due to their heritage and their relationship with the old gods, they get **+1 point** in a **frost** spell from the Destruction school. Their racial power is the **Ice Throat**, that gives them **+1 die** in attack or defense rolls with frost spells or blows.
