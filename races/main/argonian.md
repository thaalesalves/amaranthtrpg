**[Argonians](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Argonian)** (**Saxhleel**, or **People of the Root** in their native language of Jel) are the reptilian natives of **[Black Marsh](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Black_Marsh)**, a vast swampland province in southeastern **[Tamriel](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. The other races often refer to them as "lizards" or the "Lizard Folk" instead, especially when meaning to be derogatory. They are known as the foremost experts in guerrilla warfare throughout Tamriel, a reputation brought upon them by defending their borders from enemies for countless centuries. They have a connection to the Hist, a race of sentient trees.

## Characteristics
Argonians are known for their agility and endurance in hard and even toxic environments. Those born under the sign of the Shadow are known as **[Shadowscales](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shadowscales)**, and are given to the **[Dark Brotherhood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dark_Brotherhood)** as babies, and raised under the teachings of the Brotherhood. They're worshippers of **[Sithis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sithis)**, and all their culture is based on the Chaos of the Void, as well as being great mages using the Hist or the arcane arts. They get **+1 point** in Endurance **or** Agility, and **+1 point** in Stealth, Pickpocket, Restoration, Spear, Alchemy **or** Destruction. Due to their ritualistic and tribal nature, they get **+1 point** in Rituals, and **+1 point** in some spell from the Destruction or Restoration school, depending on which one the character's more prominent with. **Hist Sap** gives them the ability to breath under water.
