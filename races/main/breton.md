**[Bretons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Breton)** (from the **[Ehlnofex](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ehlnofex_Languages)** **beratu** meaning "half", also known as the **Manmer**) are a human race of elven ancestry that inhabits **[High Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock)**. They are united in culture and language, but divided politically, for High Rock is fractious. Bretons make up the peasantry, soldiery, and magical elite of the feudal kingdoms competing for power within High Rock. Bretons are known for their intelligence and have a quick and perceptive grasp of spellcraft, enchantment, and alchemy. Even the humblest of Bretons can boast a high resistance to destructive and dominating magical energies. This natural affinity for the magical arts is attributed to their Elven blood.
