**[Khajiit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit)** (from **[Ta'agra](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/hrafnirs-languages-nordic#Ta'agra)**, meaning desert-dweller) are cat-like people who come from **[Elsweyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elsweyr)**, known for high intelligence and agility. These traits make them very good thieves and acrobats, but Khajiit are also fearsome warriors. However, they are rarely known to be mages. Khajiit mostly stay on land, but piracy and **[skooma](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skooma)** trade does draw some to work as sailors. Khajiit anatomy differs greatly from both men and elves, not only because of their fur, tail, and sometimes toe-walking stance, but also their digestive system and metabolism. Khajiit, **[Argonians](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Argonian)**, and **[Imga](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit)** are the so-called "beast races" of **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)** because of these large differences. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. There are no well-documented cases of cross-breeding between Khajiit and other races, though there are rumors of such a thing. The foreign appearance and behavior of Khajiit make them common targets of racial discrimination, being given the name Cat-Men by foreigners, which the Khajiit don't take lightly to.

## Characteristics
### Ohmes and Ohmes-raht
Ohmes look very similar to the **[Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)**, although they're a bit taller. It is common for Ohmes to have facial tattoos to remind them of their feline nature. Different from other Khajiit, they don't have fur or tails, and look very similar to humans and elves. Ohmes-raht, on the other hand, have fur although very little, and are taller than Ohmes, and they also have tails. Just like humans and elves, Ohmes and Ohmes-raht have legs and feet like humans and elves instead of paws, like other Khajiit breeds. Their human-line appearance gives them **+1 point** in Charisma **or** Manipulation, and **+1 point** in Speechcraft **or** Politics.

### Suthay and Suthay-raht
Similar in height to the Ohmes, but this is about the only similarity between them. Suthay have a more feline appearance, with taller ears and a feline face, with a long tail and digitigrade paws. Suthay-raht are very similar to the Suthay in almost everything, despite their stature being closer to a human's. Suthay-raht are the most common variation of Khajiit outside of Elsweyr. They get **+1 point** in Agility **or** Manipulation, as well as **+1 point** in Stealth **or** Pickpocket.

### Cathay and Cathay-raht
Similar to the Suthay-raht in appearance and for being bipedal, despite having a larger stature and being stronger. Cathay-raht are even larger and stronger, and are described as jaguar-man. They get **+1 point** in Endurance *or** Strength, as well as **+1 point** in Athletics **or** Brawl.

### Dagi and Dagi-raht
The Dagi live in the trees in the Tenmar Forest. Due to their lower size and weight, they can live in the highest branches that even Bosmer can't reach. The Dagi have a natural affinity to magic, and are great sorcerers, a trait used as an advantage in Khajiiti war tactics. The Dagi-raht are similar in every aspect, but they're larger in size. They get **+1 point** in Agility **or** Willpower, as well as **+1 point** in Stealth **or** Magic.

### Alfiq
The **[Alfiq](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alfiq)** are a smaller form of Khajiit, naturally gifted with magic. In appearance, they look identical to housecats, and people from outside Elsweyr may usually treat them as such. Some use this as an advantage to win people over and get into their lives, and others take offense when they're compared to housecats. Due to this common confusion with housecats, Alfiq are rarely seen outside of Elsweyr. Due to their cute appearance that may fool the layman, they get **+1 point** in Manipulation  **or** Charisma. They also get **+1 point** in Magic, as well as **+1 point** in a chosen spell of any school of magic.
