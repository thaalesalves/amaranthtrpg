The **[Dunmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer)**, also called ***Dark Elves** or the archaic **Moriche**, are the ash-skinned, typically red-eyed elven peoples of **[Morrowind](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Morrowind)**. In the **[Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)**, "Dark Elf" is the common usage, but among their **[Aldmeri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** brethren they are called "Dunmer".  "Dark" is variously interpreted as meaning "dark-skinned", "gloomy", and "ill-favored by fate", with the Dunmer and their national identity embracing these various connotations with enthusiasm. Their combination of powerful intellects with strong and agile physiques produce superior warriors and sorcerers. On the battlefield, Dunmer are noted for their skill with a balanced integration of the sword, the bow and destruction magic. Dunmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Dunmer being old and a 300-year-old Dunmer being very, very old. In character, they are grim, aloof, and reserved, as well as distrusting and disdainful of other races.

# Characteristics
The Dunmer are known for their aptitude with the arcane arts, inherited from their **[Chimeri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Chimer)** ancestrals, and have cultivated these arts during their entire history. They're known for having three living gods, Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil, that with the enormous power acquired through the **[Heart](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Heart_of_lorkhan)** of **[Lorkhan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lorkhan)**, the Missing God, were able to bring **[Morrowind](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Morrowind)** to glory. Due to political and power fights throughout the province, they don't trust the other Tamrielic races too much, and get **+1 point** Charisma, Manipulation, Intelligence **or** Willpower. They also get **+1 point** in a chosen Knowledge (the third Ability column). They get **+1 point** in the Mentor, Resource **or** Status backgrounds, as well as **+1 point** in a spell in the character's most prominent school of magic. **Vehk's Fury** gives them **+1 point** in attacks and defenses related to fire.
