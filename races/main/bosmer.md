The **[Bosmer](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)** are the Elven clan-folk of **[Valenwood](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Valenwood)**, a forested province in southwestern **[Tamriel](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**. In the Empire, they are often referred to as **Wood Elves**, but Bosmer, Boiche, or the Tree-Sap people is what they call themselves. Bosmer rejected the stiff, formal traditions of **[Aldmeri](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmer)** high culture, preferring a more romantic, simple existence in harmony with the land and its wild beauty and creatures. They are relatively nimble and quick in body compared to their more "civilized" **[Altmeri](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)** cousins (who often look down upon the Bosmer as unruly and naive). Their agility makes them well-suited as scouts and thieves. However, they are also a quick-witted folk, and many pursue successful careers in scholarly pursuits or trading. Bosmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Bosmer being old and a 300-year-old Bosmer being very, very old. Though they are considered less influential than some of their Elven brethren, the Bosmer are also relatively prone to producing offspring with 12 being considered average number of children in the family. As a result, they outnumber all other **[Mer](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mer)** on Tamriel.
