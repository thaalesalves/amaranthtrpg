# Terra Nova

**Warning:** this headcanon uses a lot of metalore, which is a bit... trippy. The references made will have links to the related article as usual, but be advised that it's a deep and long read to actually grasp the concepts here. But it's an interesting read nonetheless.

## General concepts
The Mirror Logicians were already capable of trans[kalpic](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kalpa) travel, and even trans-amaranthic ones, known the Dreams of [Yokuda](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Yokuda) and [Akavir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akavir). Travels to [Yokuda by Cyrus and the Imperials](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/tiber-septim%E2%80%99s-sword-meeting-cyrus-restless) have been done, and the Legions led by [Emperor Uriel V](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uriel_V) have already traveled to Akavir, [the future-dream of Vivec](http://c0da.es), in which they founded the city of [Septimia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Septimia) in [Tsaesci](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tsaesci_(place)), before being decimated by the [latter](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tsaesci_(race)).

There were other Akaviri invasions to [Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel), once of them had the creation of the [Ebonheart Pact](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ebonheart_Pact) as a result, when [Jorunn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jorunn) and the [Tribunal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gods_T#Tribunal) joined forces to drive out the forces of the [Kamal](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kamal), who invaded eastern Tamriel, as well as the Tsaesci invasion of Tamriel during the Second Era, which ended in the foundation of the [Second Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Empire) - the [Dragonguard](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragonguard), original name of the [Blades](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Blades), was formed by the Tsaesci warriors that invaded Tamriel. The legendary snake-men that gave origin to the modern Imperial races, that also ruled over the Empire during the first four centuries of the Second Era as Potentates (e.g., [Versidue-Shaie](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Versidue-Shaie) and [Savirien-Chorak](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Savirien-Chorak)).

But after these episodes, no one knows if transkalpic or trans-amaranthic travels were made. A mysteryous [letter from the Fifth Era](https://www.c0da.es/t/loveletter) was found, and it talked about future events, or even parallel events. No one knows if what Jubal lun-Sul said regarded the current [kalpa](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kalpa), a pasta kalpa or even a future kalpa, but it is known that Jubal and [Vivec](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec) became the Amaranths of Akavir, parents of [Tosh-Raka](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tosh_Raka), the Dragon-Tiger of [Ka Po' Tun](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ka_Po'_Tun(place)), an Akaviri [race](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ka_Po'_Tun(race)) that always had the desire of invading Tamriel, but for some reason they haven't (yet).

The kalpic cycle starts and ends, at times not existing linearly until the aspect of Time takes form. During the [Dawn](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Monomyth), the [beginning of this kalpa](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad), [Auri-El](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Auri-El), the Dragon of Time - known by humans as [Akatosh](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akatosh) -  was the first [et'Ada](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gods) to take form. Time became linear, and everything had a beginning, a middle and an end. This process repeats itself, and the current kalpa ends so the next may begin. The Dragons, fragments of AKA, the Oversoul of Time, know this, and, together with the Jills, correct temporal defects until [Alduin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alduin), the part of AKA that consumes the kalpa, eats everything in existence so that the [Dawn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dawn_Era) begins again.

## Campaign plot
In 4E 156, a small group of [College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:College_of_Winterhold) alumni, composed by three veteran students, the Breton called [Erwan Dunlain](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Augur_of_Dunlain), whom specialized in the school of Restoration, an Altmer called Landlas Thramn, specialized in Mysticism and Alteration and [Arniel Gane](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Arniel_Gane), a Breton specialized in Alteration and Conjuration. Studies about the matter that composes reality were made, besides the [Psijic Endeavor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Psijic_Endeavor) of [Saint Veloth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Saint_Veloth), the [Tonal Architecture](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tonal_Architecture) of the [Dwemer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dwemer) and [CHIM](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:CHIM). Basing their work on writings of [Vivec](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec), in the life of [Tiber Septim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim), in the works of [Sotha Sil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sotha_Sil) and [Kagrenac](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kagrenac), and studying the exodus of the [Chimer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Chimer) they managed to discover the the composition of the Universe, and had access to ancient Imperial documents from the Mirror Logicians.

They found that in other kalpas things work differently, wars that never happened here happened in them, other races ruled over the world, Aspects and Metaphors had other names. But they found something else: the Amaranth. With the written studies of Vivec, they found [Sermon 37](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_37), that had been lost, and talks about the Amaranth. The Dreamer, the All-Maker, that come from a past Dream and walked the Walking Ways, reaching the Fifth and the Sixth: CHIM and Amaranth, respectively. They found that Ald-Anu, the Dreamer of Tamriel-Actual, was probably a Yokudan. Coming from the past Dream, he took his own interpretation of the world so the Aurbis could come to be, in the intersection of him and His Other.

In their Amaranthic reasearch, they found another Dream, with its own Amaranth. Trans-amaranthic travels are confusing, since when an inhabitant of one Dream travels to another, the way they perceive reality depends directly on this Dream's Dreamer. They found a very different world, although similar. Its Amaranth, called Yahweh, had a different view of reality. There were only humans; magic had apparently died centuries ago. With many lights, tall buildings, machines that moved by themselves and took people to their destinations. The language was incomprehensible, and people were joined, although separated. Everyone was in a hurry all the time.

In an attempt of going to this Dream, Erwan ended up dying. Actually, he lost of form, but not his conscience. Somehow, he transcended, and rematerialized in a pool of pure energy. The depths of the College, where they practiced their studies, were sealed away; the place came to be known as the Midden. The mass of energy Erwan turned into was put in a well, and he became seen as a sort of an oracle, and now he's called the Augur of Dunlain. Landlas disappeared, and was never seen again. Arniel graduated and became a professor at the College, and kept doing research about reality, becoming obsessed with the Dwemer.
