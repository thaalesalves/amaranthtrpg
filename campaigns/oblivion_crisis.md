# The Oblivion Crisis

The Oblivion Crisis was a great war between the Daedra and the population of Tamriel. It all began with the murder of Emperor Uriel Septim VII and all of his heirs. Soon after, Gates of Oblivion to the Deadlands started opening throughout Tamriel, and Daedra started coming out, as planned the fanatic cult to Mehrunes Dagon, known as the Mythic Dawn. General devastation and casualties were caused in all provinces. They took Skyrim, and devastated the Old Holds. In the Black Marsh, the Hist summoned Argonians to fight against the invading Daedra. The Daedric commanders closed many gates to avoid Argonians from coming into Oblivion to fight them in their own land. In Cyrodiil, the city of Kvatch of completely destroyed.

Emperor Uriel Septim VIII was murdered by the Mythic Dawn, led by Mankar Camoran. Before murdering the Emperor, the cultists murdered all of the Septim family, leaving the Ruby Throne without a heir. The Dragonfires went out without a Dragonborn Emperor to light them, and the Covenant made between Akatosh And Alessia was broken once again, leaving Mundus without its protection against Daedric invasions.

The city of Kvatch, at the heart of the Gold Coast, was invaded by Daedric forces, and was completely decimated. Innocents died, commoners, nobles, Count Kvatch and his family... Scamp, Xiviliai, Dremora, Clannfear... many of these creatures were scattered around the city - all all around Tamriel. Huge portals, about 20 meters tall, are scattered around Tamriel, surrounding cities and killing people.

The Crystal Tower, one of the metaphysical Towers of Tamriel - located in Cloudrest in Summerset, was deactivated and destroyed by the Daedra, and the White-Gold Tower, at the hear of the Imperial City, is also in danger. The Towers hold Mundus' reality, and when they're all deactivated, the plane is unmade and the Dawn returns. The Red Tower, the Bronze Tower, the White Tower, the Green-Sap Tower and the Oricahlc Tower have all been disabled as well, leaving only the White-Gold Tower and the Adamantine Tower to hold reality together.

The Argonians fight against the invasion with the help of the Hist, the Dunmer join the Great Houses and the Lesser Houses together against a common foe: the House of Troubles is invading the Mortal Plane with the purporse of unmaking it. Azura, Boethiah and Mephala won't let that happen, and with the disappearance of the only living god, Vivec, things get difficult for the Dunmer.

The Nords of Skyrim fight the Daedric invasion using Imperial Legions and mercenary armies hired by the Jarls, and in High Rock the political fights came to a stall so they can fight their common enemy.
