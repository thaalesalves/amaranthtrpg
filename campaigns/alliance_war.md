# The Alliance War
In 2E 430, the Second Empire went through a coup and started to ruin. Since then, the new provinces of Tamriel have been isolating themselves from external interference. This changed in 2E 579, when a big arcane explosion happened in the Imperial City, sending energy waves all over Nirn. Emperor Varen Aquilarios of Cyrodiil persihed, leaving his wife Clivia Tharn and his father-in-law Abnur Tharn, Chancellor of the Elder Council, as leaders of Cyrodiil. The growing number of Daedra started being noticeable around Tamriel, and the constellation of the Serpent grew until it dominated the night sky.

The attack of Molag Bal against Mundus took the interest of the Alliances, as the only way to stop him from invading the mortal plane would be to conquer the Ruby Throne and light the Dragonfires to restablish the Convenant of Alessia and protect Mundus from Oblivion. 

Even with a large scale attack from Daedric forces, the fight for the Ruby Throne keeps going. Spionage, open battles, racism, genocide. Everything happens in Tamriel. Even in closed territories there are fights happened. Elves from Auridon, for example, cannot go to the Summerset Isle without bureaucracy. Inhabitants of Auridon resent those from Summerset, the many kingdoms in Valenwood fight each other, with the Silvenar and the Camoran King having united with the Aldmeri Dominion - with the city of Elden Root being the capital of all the Dominion, which caused even more resentments between Bosmer and Altmer, sicne the latter think Alinor should be celebrated as the capital of the Dominion. The Wilderking did not join the Dominion, and the region of Greenshade remains independent, with the Green Pact reigning supreme over it.

Tensions grown in Morrowind, with the Telvanni having refused to join the Ebonheart Pact, that united Nords, Dunmer and Argonians. Slavery was banned in all the territories of the Pact, but the Telvanni refused to leave their cheap labor, and remain in a slavery regime. The Argonians are in conflict in the south, since many of them stopped worshipping Sithis with the coming of cities and society, and the local population worries about sacred relics that have been stolen.

In the northeast, in High Rock, the political fights between the Breton kings are everywhere, as usual. Royal families fight over land, dukes and kings war over cities, and bad influences from Daedra causa all kinds of conflicts in the province.
