# The Alliance War

This is a campaign bundle based on the story of _The Elder Scrolls Online_. It has three campaigns that share a backstory, but each campaign is for one of the factions involved in the war, and will follow a similar path to the story seen on ESO. Although the events of the Planemeld are mentioned, they are the story of a different campaign, with this bundle being focused on the Three Banners War itself. The story arch for all campaigns will be broken into acts with general descriptions of the environments, with Narrator notes where necessary and general instructions to help the Narrator guide the story.

## Backstory
In **[2E 430](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era)**, the **[Second Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Empire)** went through a coup and started to ruin. Since then, the new provinces of **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)** have been isolating themselves from external interference. This changed in 2E 579, when a big arcane explosion happened in the **[Imperial City](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_City)**, sending energy waves all over Nirn. Emperor **[Varen Aquilarios](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Varen_Aquilarios)** of **[Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodiil)** perished, leaving his wife **[Clivia Tharn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Clivia_Tharn)** and his father-in-law **[Abnur Tharn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Abnur_Tharn)**, Chancellor of the **[Elder Council](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elder_Council)**, as leaders of Cyrodiil. The growing number of Daedra started being noticeable around Tamriel, and the constellation of the Serpent grew until it dominated the night sky.

The attack of **[Molag Bal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Molag_Bal)** against Mundus took the interest of the Alliances, as the only way to stop him from invading the mortal plane would be to conquer the **[Ruby Throne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ruby_Throne)** and light the **[Dragonfires](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragonfires)** to reestablish the **[Convenant](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Trials_of_St._Alessia)** of **[Alessia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia)** and protect **[Mundus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mundus)** from **[Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Oblivion)**.

Even with a large scale attack from **[Daedric](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedra)** forces, the fight for the Ruby Throne keeps going. Spionage, open battles, racism, genocide. Everything happens in Tamriel. Even in closed territories there are fights happened. Elves from **[Auridon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Auridon)**, for example, cannot go to the **[Summerset Isle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Summerset_Isle)** without bureaucracy. Inhabitants of Auridon resent those from Summerset, the many kingdoms in **[Valenwood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Valenwood)** fight each other, with the **[Silvenar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Silvenar)** and the **[Camoran King](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aeradan_Camoran)** having united with the **[Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:First_Aldmeri_Dominion)** - with the city of **[Elden Root](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elden_Root)** being the capital of all the Dominion, which caused even more resentments between **[Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)** and **[Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)**, since the latter think **[Alinor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alinor)** should be celebrated as the capital of the Dominion. The **[Wilderking](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Wilderking)** did not join the Dominion, and the region of **[Greenshade](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Greenshade)** remains independent, with the **[Green Pact](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Green_Pact)** reigning supreme over it.

Tensions grown in **[Morrowind](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Morrowind)**, with the **[Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Telvanni)** having refused to join the **[Ebonheart Pact](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ebonheart_Pact)**, that united **[Nords](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord)**, **[Dunmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer)** and **[Argonians](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Argonian)**. Slavery was banned in all the territories of the Pact, but the Telvanni refused to leave their cheap labor, and remain in a slavery regime. The Argonians are in conflict in the south, since many of them stopped worshipping **[Sithis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sithis)** with the coming of cities and society, and the local population worries about sacred relics that have been stolen.

In the northeast, in **[High Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock)**, the political fights between the Breton kings are everywhere, as usual. Royal families fight over land, dukes and kings war over cities, and bad influences from Daedra cause all kinds of conflicts in the province.

## Alliances
### Ebonheart Pact
The Ebonheart Pact is a military alliance between the Tamrielic provinces of Morrowind (with the exception of House Telvanni), Eastern Skyrim and **[Black Marsh](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Black_Marsh)**, formed during the **[Interregnum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Interregnum)** of the Second Era. The faction was created after the Nords of Skyrim and the Dunmer of Morrowind joined together to drive out the forces of the **[Kamal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kamal_(race))**, an **[Akaviri](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Akavir)** society that had invaded eastern Tamriel and taken the city of **[Windhelm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Windhelm)**, the capital of Eastern Skyrim, by force. **[Queen Mabjaarn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mabjaarn_Flame-Hair)** and her heir, **[Nurnhilde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nurnhilde)**, was slain during the invasion, leaving the crown to the Queen's son, **[Jorunn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jorunn)**. **[Ada'Soom Dir-Kamal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ada'Soom_Dir-Kamal)**'s army fled east during one of the battles, only to be be met by Dunmeri forces under **[Almalexia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Almalexia)**'s command. In an unprecedented episode of cooperation between the rival races, King Jorunn and Almalexia joined forces to fight the Kamal, which ended the invasion for good then Dir-Kamal's forces fled Tamriel.

This led to treaties being signed between the two countries, which led to the creation of the Ebonheart Pact. One of the many conditions of the treaty was the banishment of slavery in the lands of Morrowind, which most **[Great Houses](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Great_Houses)** agreed to, with the exception of House Telvanni, which did not join the Pact. This ended hundreds of years of conflicts between the Dunmer of Morrowind and the Argonians of Black Marsh, the latter having been enslaved by the former for a very long time. Following this, the Argonians joined the Pact. Its capital was set in the city of **[Ebonheart](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ebonhear)**, in northern continental Morrowind.

After the events of Cyrodiil with the death of the Emperor and wars between political factions for the **[Ruby Throne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ruby_Throne)**, the Pact decided to join in the war and rule over the **[Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)**.

### Aldmeri Dominion
The First **[Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeri_Dominion)** was founded in 2E 580 by **[Queen Ayrenn of Alinor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ayrenn)**. The Dominion was created once Ayrenn assumed the Throne of **[Summerset](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Summerset_Isles)**, with the objective of taking over the lands of Tamriel under the banner of the Aldmeri Dominion, placing Tamriel under elven rule once again by replacing the **[Second Empire of Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Empire)**, originally founded by **[Reman Cyrodiil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_Cyrodiil)** in the **[First Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:First_Era)**. As the Altmer believe they are the rightful rulers of Tamriel for being direct descendants of the original **[Ehlnofey](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ehlnofey)**, Ayrenn felt like it was their duty to right the wrongs of the Empire and put an end to the corruption in the world.

With all the troubles happening in both **[Valenwood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Valenwood)** and **[Elsweyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elsweyr)**, the Bosmer and the Khajiit signed the Elden Accord, joining the Dominion and setting its capital in the city of **[Elden Root](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elden_Root)**, capital of Valenwood.

After the events of Cyrodiil with the death of the Emperor and wars between political factions for the Ruby Throne, the Dominion decided to join the war and rule over the Empire.

### Daggerfall Covenant
The **[Daggerfall Covenant](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daggerfall_Covenant)** was founded in 2E 542 to fight off the **[Reachmen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reachmen)** invasion in eastern **[High Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock)**. During this time, the rival kingdoms of High Rock joined forces to drive out the invading Reachmen, founding the Daggerfall Covenant in the aftermath. The pact was originally signed by the kingdoms of **[Daggerfall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daggerfall)**, **[Wayrest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Wayrest)**, **[Camlorn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Camlorn)**, **[Evermore](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Evermore)** and **[Shornhelm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shornhelm)**, as a defensive pact against invading forces. During the times of the **[Knahaten Flu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Knahaten_Flu)**, **[Emeric of Cumberland](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Emeric)** ascended to the throne of Wayrest, becoming High King of the Daggerfall Covenant.

The **[Redguards](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Redguard)** of **[Hammerfell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hammerfell)** joined the pact when Emeric wed **[Fahara'jad](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Fahara'jad)**'s daughter, **[Princess Maraya](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Maraya)**. Although this straightened relations between Bretons and Redguards, this enraged **[King Ranser](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ranser)** of Shornhelm, as Emeric had been betrothed to his daughter but married Maraya instead. This caused him to storm Wayrest for revenge, but the other kingdoms of High Rock helped Emeric fight Shornhelm, and Fahara'jad's armies joined in. When Ranser's forces returned to Shornhelm, they found the city sacked by the **[Orcs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orc)** of **[Orsinium](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orsinium)** under **[King Kurog](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kurog)**, also called in by Emeric, who promised the Orcs recognition of Orsinium's sovereignty in exchange for aid in this war. Ranser was utterly crushed, and these events straightened the Covenant, expanding its goal to conquer the Empire that was in ruins. Now Bretons, Redguards and Orcs were all joined together with a common goal, an episode that was also unprecedented, as Orcs were frequent victims of Redguards and Bretons, who kept sacking Orsinium throughout history.

After the events of Cyrodiil with the death of the Emperor and wars between political factions for the Ruby Throne, the Covenant decided to join the war and rule over the Empire.
