## Initial background
**[Khenarthi's Roost](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khenarthi's_Roost)**, the Isle of Three Temples, is a small island south of **[Elsweyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elsweyr)**'s coast, historically inhabited by both **[Khajiit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit)** and **[Maormer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Maormer)**. **[King Orgnum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orgnum)** of **[Pyandonea](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pyandonea)** agreed to share power over the island with the mayor of **[Mistral](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mistral)**, so the island is recognized by both the Khajiit of Elsweyr and the Maormer of Pyandonea. The island is bustling with wildlife and **[moon sugar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moon_Suger)** plantations, but these relations with the Maormer delayed the **[Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeri_Dominion)**'s invite for them to join their new empire. The island is famous for being home to three important Khajiiti temples, the **[Dark Moons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dark_Moons)**, Crescent Moons and **[Two-Moons Dance](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Two-Moons_Dance)** temple. In ancient times, it was ruled by **[Uldor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uldor)**, a powerful Maormer necromancer that learned to separated his spirit from his body and would use that to control his victims, even after death. He was so powerful that he could "wear" people's bodies and control them as his own, and would even control multiple people at once. His reign of terror only ended after his spirit was sealed away in the Temple of Mourning Springs.

In **[2E 582](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era)**, the Dominion finally invited Khenarthi's Roost to join them, and sent officials to check the island, especially the large moon sugar plantations to find illegal production of **[Skooma](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skooma)**, an illicit narcotic common to Elsweyr that is made from raw moon sugar. The Dominion had sent a delegation with the **[Silvenar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Silvenar) [Edhelorn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Edhelorn)** and the **[Green Lady](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Green_Lady) [Finoriell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Finoriell)**, both being the embodiment of the **[Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)** people. The fleet was wrecked in the coast by a sudden and mysterious storm that appeared, with many crew members being abducted by the **[Sea Vipers](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sea_Vipers)**, a faction of Maormer pirates. The Great Tree, a spiritual icon for the Khajiit, was infested with **[kwama](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kwama)** after the wreck, which were eating the roots of the famous tree, and things got worse when Dominion researchers removed the **[Mourning Stone](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mourning_Stone)** from Uldor's Tomb, his spirit started plaguing the island with undead. Viewing Khenarthi's Roost as Maormer territorial waters, Ambassador **[Ulondil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ulondil)** was justifiably outraged at the **[Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)** proposition of the island joining the Dominion.

## Adventure start
The adventure starts in the Aldmeri Dominion fleet, with all Altmer and Bosmer characters in the ship. This can be used as a moment for the PCs to gather together and talk, and get to know each other, as well as present themselves to the game. They are Aldmeri Dominion soldiers that came with the fleet to help scout and inspect the island.

When Khenarthi's Roost is in sight, the First Mate, Admiral Armidil yells "We're arriving! Everyone, out of their quarters or whatever, docking!". But right after the Admiral says that, Captain Anarenen says "What the hell? Where in Oblivion did that storm come from?" and points to a mysterious black storm that appeared out of nowhere right in front of the ship. The ship is struck by the storm, and the Captain is heard yelling "Abandon ship! Abandon ship!", and some of the crew manage to jump off of the ship, but some don't. Between the ones who managed, are the PCs. They wake up by the beach, with soldiers and medics of the local Khenarthian army, a force mixed of Maormer and Khajiit that came to help.

After helping the fallen and castaway members of the fleet, including the Silvenar and the Green Lady, who will lead the operation, the soldiers take them to Mistral's health installation to care for them. Since the PCs in the ship managed to swim away, they're not hurt, but they're very tired. Once they've rested (two days later), the Admiral orders them to continue with their duties in the island, while researchers, ambassadors and other officials did their own job.

## Act 1: Aldmeri Troubles
The first act of the story will be focused on increasing the Dominion's reputation in Khenarthi's Roost. During these events of piracy threats, criminality and a sudden undead attack, the Dominion's help will be decisive in making sure the population of Khenarthi's Roost stays safe, and that they support the Dominion as well. This arch of the story concludes when the PCs have solved all the problems in Khenarthi's Roost to make sure they join and support the Aldmeri Dominion.

### Quest: Sweet Troubles and Their Roots
#### Conflicts
- This arch focuses on helping the local inhabitants of Khenarthi's Roost deal with a few of their problems. With undead and pirate threats all around the place, criminal activities raised too. A moon sugar farm was set on fire, and Officer Lorin was tasked with the inspection of this activity.
- A young Khajiit was kidnapped, and his mother Zulana is desperate to get him back. She sees some soldiers wearing Khenarthian and Dominion armor (the PCs) and claims for their help.
- Spinner Benieth is looking after the Great Tree, a spiritual tree near Windcatcher Plantation and the shipwreck. The PCs have to help her heal the tree so the plantation may be healthy again.
- The Laughing Moons Plantation is infested with thunderbugs eating out the farm's moon sugar crops

#### Locations
- The City of Mistral (a Khajiiti settlement in the northern part of the island)
- Windcatcher Plantation
- Speckled Shell Plantation
- Hazak's Hollow

#### Characters
- Razum-dar
- Inspector Lorin
- Azbi-ra
- Zaban-ma
- Hazak

#### Story
The PCs will be at an inn that was reserved for the Dominion officials that would arrive in the fleet, a couple of days after the wreck. **Razum-dar**, a high raking **Thalmor** official, will approach them and tell them about their current duties. The Thalmor has received reports about troubles in the island that started after the storm hit. He hands the reports to the party and explains to them what it is about.

There are two report files in the folder he has handed the party, specifying that some moon sugar plantations are having trouble with mysterious infestations that began after the storm that wrecked their ship, and they are to investigate what is happening at these farms. These events might or might not be related to the storm, but they need to be investigated nonetheless.

##### Report: Fire at Speckled Shell Plantation

> A farm in the southeasternmost part of the island was burned to the ground by an unknown individual or group, and the entire plantation was destroyed. Azbi-ra, daughter of Khartajo, the local farmer, does not want to cooperate with more info on what happened.
>
> There is an infestation of skeevers in the farm, frothing mouths, which is a lot like the effects of an overdose of Skooma. I request more aid in this investigation to find out what happened at the farm.
>
> Signed: Inspector Lorin, Thalmor Official

The PCs will head to the farm and talk to **Inspector Lorin**. She will tell the PCs what they know and ask them to talk to **Azbi-ra**, since she does not want to talk to Lorin.

**Azbi-ra** will then say that she runs the farm with her father and who brother, and both have gone missing. She will then ask the players to investigate the farm to find the alchemical tools their family uses, so she can at least try to trade them for medicine.

The PCs will investigate the farmhouse looking for the materials, and will eventually be approached by **Zaban-ma**, Azbi-ra's brother (who she said was missing). He will accuse them of being bandits and skooma dealers, and threats to kill them if they continue looting his family's plantation.

When he knows that the PCs are looking for his sister's alchemical materials, he will explain that he himself set the alchemical tools on fire because she's been brewing skooma, but the fire got out of control and burned the entire farm down, and now their father is missing. Lorin will appear and say she found a corpse near one of the planting grounds, being eaten away by the skeevers. He then explains that he saw his sister burying something near the beach, and Lorin tells the PCs to investigate that.

The skooma will be buried under the sand like he said, and when the PCs get back to the farm, they're mourning their father, whom they had buried. Because of the skooma found, Lorin threatens to arrest both of them, and Zaban-ma pleads innocence but she wants to question him anyway. Azbi-ra tells them that she was forced to brew the skooma because Hazak, a local criminal, threated to kill their entire family if she didn't use their moon sugar to produce skooma for him and his gang. She then tells the PCs and Lorin that he can be found in his hollow to the north, a cave under the ground that is facing the open sea.

The PCs will then head to the hollow and confront Hazak. His guards will attack, and he can be taken dead or alive back to Lorin; if alive, he will be interrogated by the Thalmor; if dead, the Thalmor will investigate his hollow for evidence.

Once these conflicts are solved, the PCs are ready to move to the next part of the story.
