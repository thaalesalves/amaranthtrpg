## Initial background
**[Khenarthi's Roost](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khenarthi's_Roost)**, the Isle of Three Temples, is a small island south of **[Elsweyr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Elsweyr)**'s coast, historically inhabited by both **[Khajiit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit)** and **[Maormer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Maormer)**. **[King Orgnum](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orgnum)** of **[Pyandonea](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pyandonea)** agreed to share power over the island with the mayor of **[Mistral](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mistral)**, so the island is recognized by both the Khajiit of Elsweyr and the Maormer of Pyandonea. The island is bustling with wildlife and **[moon sugar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moon_Suger)** plantations, but these relations with the Maormer delayed the **[Aldmeri Dominion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aldmeri_Dominion)**'s invite for them to join their new empire. The island is famous for being home to three important Khajiiti temples, the **[Dark Moons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dark_Moons)**, Crescent Moons and **[Two-Moons Dance](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Two-Moons_Dance)** temple. In ancient times, it was ruled by **[Uldor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Uldor)**, a powerful Maormer necromancer that learned to separated his spirit from his body and would use that to control his victims, even after death. He was so powerful that he could "wear" people's bodies and control them as his own, and would even control multiple people at once. His reign of terror only ended after his spirit was sealed away in the Temple of Mourning Springs.

In **[2E 582](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era)**, the Dominion finally invited Khenarthi's Roost to join them, and sent officials to check the island, especially the large moon sugar plantations to find illegal production of **[Skooma](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skooma)**, an illicit narcotic common to Elsweyr that is made from raw moon sugar. The Dominion had sent a delegation with the **[Silvenar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Silvenar) [Edhelorn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Edhelorn)** and the **[Green Lady](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Green_Lady) [Finoriell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Finoriell)**, both being the embodiment of the **[Bosmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bosmer)** people. The fleet was wrecked in the coast by a sudden and mysterious storm that appeared, with many crew members being abducted by the **[Sea Vipers](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sea_Vipers)**, a faction of Maormer pirates. The Great Tree, a spiritual icon for the Khajiit, was infested with **[kwama](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kwama)** after the wreck, which were eating the roots of the famous tree, and things got worse when Dominion researchers removed the **[Mourning Stone](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mourning_Stone)** from Uldor's Tomb, his spirit started plaguing the island with undead. Viewing Khenarthi's Roost as Maormer territorial waters, Ambassador **[Ulondil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ulondil)** was justifiably outraged at the **[Altmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Altmer)** proposition of the island joining the Dominion.

## Adventure start
The adventure starts in the Aldmeri Dominion fleet, with all Altmer and Bosmer characters in the ship. Upon arriving in Khenarthi's Roost, the First Mate, Admiral Armidil yells "We're arriving! Everyone, out of their quarters or whatever, docking!". But right after the Admiral says that, Captain Anarenen says "What the fuck? Where did that storm come from?" and points to a mysterious black storm that appeared out of nowhere right in front of the ship. The ship is struck by the storm, and the Captain is heard yelling "Abandon ship! Abandon ship!", and some of the crew manage to jump off of the ship, but some don't. Between the ones who managed, are the PCs. They wake up by the beach, with soldiers and medics of the local Khenartian army, a force mixed of Maormer and Khajiit that came to help. It is here that the PCs that were on the ship meet the PCs that are Khajiit of Maormer, who were already in the island. If the PC is an Alfiq, though, they will meet later.

After helping the fallen and castaway members of the fleet, including the Silvenar and the Green Lady, the soldiers take them to Mistral's health installation to care for them. Since the PCs in the ship managed to swim away, they're not hurt, but they're very tired. Once they've rested, the Admiral orders them to continue with their jobs in the island, while researchers, ambassadors and other officials did their own job. Mayor Harrani orders the local soldiers (the other PCs) to instruct and aid the Dominion officials in their duties, and Razum-dar, a high ranking official of the Dominion, will be your reporting official.
