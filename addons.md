# Add-ons

The Narrator may decide to add extra mechanics to your campaign. Amaranth comes with a set of add-ons based on the Elder Scrolls universe that add mechanics that are featured in the games but adapted to a Storyteller TRPG context.

- **[Astrology](/addons/astrology):** constellations your character was born under. They may add buffs or debuffs to your character.
- **[Guilds](/addons/guilds):** guilds your character may be a member of. They may add buffs or debuffs to your character, as well as influence or gear.
- **[Religion](/addons/religion):** religions your character may follow. They may add buffs or debuffs to your character based on which religion and/or god(s) your character worships.
- **[Races of Tamriel](/addons/races):** additional races for you to choose from. This add-on includes rare or extinct races that are unplayable in the main games of the series, with their own buffs and debuffs.
