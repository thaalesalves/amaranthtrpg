# Races
Tamriel has a myriad of sentient races. They vary from humans to elves to bestial and giant creatures. Some known races are, in actuality, subsets of larger races. The Khajiit, for example, have 16 different breeds depending on the Moons' phases, and Imperials are separated into two other sub-races.
