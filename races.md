# Races
Tamriel has a myriad of sentient races. They vary from humans to elves to bestial and giant creatures. Some known races are, in actuality, subsets of larger races. The Khajiit, for example, have 16 different breeds depending on the Moons' phases, and Imperials are separated into two other sub-races.

- **[Breton](/races/main/breton):** known as the Manmer, a human race that comes from elven miscegenation
- **[Imperial](/races/main/imperial):** the cosmopolitan Imperials, humans that have ruled over Tamriel for millennia
- **[Nord](/races/main/nord):** the inhabitants of the North, known as the Children of the Sky, and the oldest humans in Tamriel
- **[Redguard](/races/main/redguard):** human inhabitants of Hammerfell, descendend from the Ra Gada of the lost continent of Yokuda
- **[Altmer](/races/main/altmer):** the oldest and purest race of elves, direct descendants of the Aldmer, also known as High Elves
