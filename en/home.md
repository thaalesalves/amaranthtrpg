The Amaranth is the Dreamer, the regent of the current Universe, where all reality is inserted. Their way of seeing things, their ideas, their thoughts, echo through reality and influence everything directly and indirectly, even though everyone's individuality is kept. While you tell your story, consider yourself to be Ald-Anu, the Amaranth of Tamriel-actual, he who came after Yokuda and before Akavir. The importance of the Amaranth within the Elder Scrolls lore gave name to this adaptation of Storyteller, implementing the Elder Scrolls series into a d10-based system.
