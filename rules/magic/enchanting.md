# Enchanting

Enchanting is the art of giving magical properties to objects through the manipulation of souls, almost always with the use of **[Soul Gems](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Soul_gem)**. The power of an enchanted item decreases as it's used, and more souls are required to charge it. The strength of an enchanted item is directly related to the magnitude of the soul used.

* Effects from clothing/armor items may increase the wearer's attributes on skills, and the effects of enchanted weapons may cause more damage to the target. Certain enchanted equipments, such as staffs, may be used to cast spells without the use of Magicka.
* Artifacts, powerful items created by **[Aedra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aedra)**, **[Daedra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedra)** or other extraordinary circumstances, are usually enchanted and must be recharged just like regular enchanted items.

Some say **[Raven Direnni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Raven_Direnni)** created the art of enchantment in the **[First Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:First_Era)**, despite sources saying that the former only revolutionized the process, that, before her work, would fail 9 out of 10 times.
