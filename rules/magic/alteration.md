# Alteration

Alteration is one of the six schools of magic. Spells of this school change the world around the caster, and physical truths become invalid. Sometimes it's confused with the school of Illusion, since both school aim to change mundane truths. The school of Illusion, however, is not subject to the laws of nature as Alteration is. The power of Alteration comes from the fact that if the nature of changes is changed, that becomes reality, and Illusion alters only what the target sees, hears or perceives, but doesn't change reality per se.
