# Illusion

Illusion is one of the six school of magic. It is similar to Alteration in what regards changing the world around the user, but for Illusions these effects do not alter reality. Despite the effects of Alteration changing what one sees, these changed affect the world itself, and Illusion simply alters what one may see, hear or perceive, with no practical effects. The ability to change the will of a target is part of this school, despite in the past having been considered part of the school of Conjuration.

* Invisibility spells come in two ways: invisibility and chameleon. The former removes the caster from sight, but is dispelled once the caster moves. The latter provides a degree of transparency to the caster, determined by the user. May vary from a simple transparency, that would still make the caster visible, to total invisibility, but that won't fade when the caster moves. The latter, obviously, is more costly to cast and requires more ability.
* Light spells are self-explanatory. They produce light from in a determined brightness and radius. In theory, these spells could produce complete darkness, but this effect hasn't been developed by mages yet.
* Sound spells come in two ways: one prevents the target from making any noise, and is used against mages, as it makes it impossible for them to cast spells. The other way, that has fallen in disuse in the past few years, makes the target hear a song, varying from a soft a murmur to a deafening cacophony.
* The blindness effect has fallen into disuse, and reduces the target's ability to see, varying from dark spots in vision to total blindness.
* Night-eye is an effect that allows the caster to see in the dark
* Many Illusion spells involve changing the target's reactions. Frenzy and Calm increase or decrease the target's aggressiveness, making them more or less prone to attack - attack even allies, or ignore powerful enemies. Charm may turn your archnemesis into a great ally, and Courage may turn the bravest warrior into a scared child, or even make a scared child come at the troop's bravest warrior
* Clairvoyance spells may be used to determine the path to something
* Muffling spells are used to annulate sounds produced by the weapons and armors of the cast, so they can move quietly and freely
