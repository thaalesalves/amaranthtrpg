# Tests

**Amaranth** is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game system based on **[Storyteller](https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Storyteller_System)**, a TRPG system created by **[White Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Wolf_Publishing)** (now owned by **[Paradox Interactive](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com)**) for the **[World of Darkness](https://www.worldofdarkness.com/)**. For **[Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net)**, along with Amaranth, there are other system, such as **[UESRPG](https://www.reddit.com/r/UESRPG/)**, a custom system that uses D100, and **[UESTRPG](https://uestrpg.wixsite.com/home)**, an adapted version of the fifth edition of the popular TRPG system **[Dungeons & Dragons](https://dnd.wizards.com/)**. Both systems are great to play with, but Amaranth takes a different approach to how the game works. Using V20 (from **Vampire: the Masquerade**) as the base, Amaranth gives more focus to the storytelling and interpretation aspects of the RPG experience, keeping the tests simpler and using only one type of dice, the ten-faced D10.

## Rolls
Tests are dice rolls. Each action or reaction might have as a requirement a roll of a determined number of dice to determine if the character has succeeded or not in the attempted action. When or how it is necessary to roll the dice is up to the Narrator (also called DM), but we have some base rules that may be followed. Of course, these rules may be tweaked, changed or molded according to the Narrator's necessity or desire.

## Difficulty
The default test difficulty is **(6)**. That means numbers higher than **(6)** are considered successes. The amount of successes rolled compared to the difficulty determine whether the character has succeeded in the desired action or not. Difficulty main be increased or decreased depending on the task attempted, meaning that the numbers required for the character to succeed in the action may be higher or lower.

For this article, we might refer to difficulties as +2 or -4. This means that that number is added to or subtracted from the difficulty defined by the Narrator for the test (or 6, if the Narrator defined no difficulty for the test, as that is the default difficulty).

## Successes and failures
By default, at least two successes are required for an action to succeed. Rolls with only a single success are considered failures, and the desired action will not be completed. Rolls without any successes are considered **critical failures**, and, besides not achieving the desired goal, something worse will happen as well. Successes are measured by the quantity of numbers that equal or are greater than the defined difficulty, taking into consideration that each **(1)** rolled annulates a success, and each **(10)** rolled is worth two successes.

**Example:** Biggus Dickus rolled **(1, 4, 8, 7, 10)**. This means he has three successes, since **(8, 7, 10)** amount to four successes but **(1)** annulates one of them.

## Rules for rolls
### Magical attacks
Two rolls are required: one that determines how well the attack has gone **(Attribute + Talent)**; and one that determines the damage **(Knowledge + Spell + successes rolled - 1)**, with the respective cost of Magicka said spell has.

The rolls to determine the blow is done by simply summing the points of the Attribute and the Talent involved in the action. The second roll is based on the sum of Knowledge + damage of the spell used; also add to the equation the amount of successes from the first roll and subtract 1.

**Example:** Mike Rotch has 3 points of Willpower and 2 points of Destruction, and is attempting to cast a fire elemental missile, that has a base damage of 3.
* First roll: **(10, 6, 3, 6, 7)**. He got five successes. The action succeded.
* Second roll: **(5, 7, 9, 9, 7, 9, 9, 2, 5)**. The dice rolled refer to his knowledge + four successes from the previous roll (since he got five and we subtracted one). He has six successes in this roll. To determine the damage, it is necessary to roll his opponent's reaction.

### Physical attacks
Two rolls are required: one that determines how well the attack has gone **(Attribute + Talent)**; and one that determines the damage **(Skill + Weapon + success rolled - 1)**.

The roll to determine the blow is done by simply summing the points of the Atribute and the Talent involved in the action. The second roll is based on the sum of Skill + damage of the weapon used; also add to the equation the amount of successes had in the first roll and subtract 1.

**Exemplo:** Huge Jazz has 3 points of Agility and 2 points of One-Handed, and is attempting to attack with a sword, that has a base damage of 5.
* First roll: **(2, 8, 10, 5, 8)**. He got four successes. The action succeded.
* Second roll: **(6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 9, 4, 6)**. The dice rolled refer to his skill + 3 successes from the previous roll (since he got four and we subtracted one). He has four successes. To determine the damage, it is necessary to rolls his opponent's reaction.

### Stealth attacks
The attacker doesn't need to roll initiative. They roll a test of Agility + Stealth to determine how well everything went.

* In case of success, the attacker rolls the usual attack test with a difficulty of -2 (meaning that, if the default difficulty defined by the Narrator is 6, the difficulty for this test will be 4). Then, they roll the opponent's armor modifier, without the related Attribute, with a difficulty of +2.
* In case of failure, the attacker misses the attempted action and the opponent automatically wins the counter-attack. You do the same rolls as above, but with the difficulties inverted (+2 for the attack and -2 for the armor).

### Initiative
Initiative is determined by rolling Willpower + Agility, and the person with the lower results declares their action first, and the person with higher results does it after. The action in itself, though, follows the opposite order: after both have declared their actions, the one with the higher values does the actual action first, and then goes the one with the lower values. In case both people have equal results, the one with the higher initiative modifier goes first.

### Dodges
A test with the modifiers of Agility + Athletics or Awareness, depending on the situation and/or what the Narrator determines.

### Attack absorption
A test with the modifiers of Endurance + Athletics or type of armor, depending on the situation and/or what the Narrator determines.

### Lockpicking
A test based on the sum of your modifiers of Stealth + Lockpicking.

**Example:** Volin Habar wants to pick the lock of a house at the Talos Plaza District in the Imperial City, and he has a skill of 4 in Stealth and 3 in Lockpicking, and, rolling the 3 dice, he got **(8, 4, 2, 5, 9, 9, 6)**. That amounts to 4 successes (with the default difficulty of 6, that may be changed by the Narrator). If the Narrator wants more than half of successes for the action to succeed, than he managed to pick the lock. Otherwise, if the Narrator has an increased required amount of successes, this action may fail even with 4 successes.

### Lore
Your character may have specific lore knowledge, and some characters, such as Sotha Sil, Vivec, Jubal lun-Sul, Divayth Fyr and Lorkhan (among others), might be capable of breaking the fourth wall, as they have the highest possible knowledge about the Universe, the **[Aurbis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aurbis)**, the Dream, the Amaranth and the Godhead itself, as well as **[CHIM](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:CHIM)**. The level of knowledge about the universe will be measured by a test of Intelligence + Lore, depending on the difficulty imposed by the Narrator.

### Alchemy
Alchemy in Amaranth was directly based on the mechanics used by **Elder Scrolls Online** and **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**, where the player needs at least two ingredients to make the infusion. The purity of the water or oil used to brew the potion determine the quality of the potion or poison prepared, respectively. Recipes are necessary to create the infusions, since it is necessary to know the effects of each ingredient. The character may also risk mixing random ingredients to see the results. In case the character does not have a recipe to a potion, the difficulty of the rolls is increased by +2. In case they do have a recipe, then the roll has the default difficulty. In case the infusion has four ingredients but doesn't have a recipe, the difficulty is then increased by +4. The modifiers used for the roll are Intelligence + Alchemy, and then Water/Oil + Ingredients. The first test defines how well the action succeeded, and the second determines if the action has in fact been done.

**Example:** Annelise Durine needs a health potion. She has some **Cleansed Water** she got from **[Coldharbour](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Coldharbour)**, an **Ambrosia** and an **Eye of Sabre Cat**. She rolls her Alchemy + Intelligence, and gets **(5, 4, 6, 7, 10)**. Four successes. She did well. The next text is for the Ingredients + Water. 3 dice will be rolled for the water (as Cleansed Water is the third type of water), +1 die per ingredient, summing up to 5 dice. **(2, 8, 6, 10, 7)**. Five successes. She succeeded in creating her health potion.

### Enchanting
Enchanting in Amaranth was directly based on the mechanics used by **Elder Scrolls Online** and **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**, where the player needs runes with a specific effect to create the enchantment, as well as a specific **[Soul Gem](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Soul_Gems)**. There are three rune categories: Potency, Essence and Aspect. For an enchantment to be created, the runes need to align, meaning their combination needs to make sense. The Aspect rune also determines how strong the enchantment will be, and gives more or fewer dice in the test.

**Example:** LÃ©x Craiment needs a fire enchantment for his sword. He as 2 points of Enchantment, a Jejora (potency rune - weak one), a Rakeipa (essence rune - fire) and a Kuta (aspect rune - legendary). He doesn't know how to use a legendary aspect rune because he doesn't have the required skill, but he managed to buy a Jejota (aspect rune - fine). He rolls his Intelligence + Enchantment modifiers and gets **(6, 8, 4, 8)**. Three successes. Then, he rolls the runes, which add up to four dice. **(8, 8, 6, 9)**. He got four successes now. Not only he succeeded in creating the enchantment, he did it very well done.
