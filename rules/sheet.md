# Character sheet

Both Amaranth's rules and sheet are based in the **20th anniversary edition** of the **World of Darkness** character sheets, that use **White Wolf's Storyteller** as the base system. Amaranth's sheet has elements and subsystems from V20 (Vampire: the Masquerade), W20 (Werewolf: the Apocalypse) and M20 (Mage: the Ascension). Attributes and abilities are revised to match the Elder Scrolls universe, and the max levels for each one of those is now 10 instead of the usual 5. With that in mind, characters may have a higher range of skills, with each point being worth less than other Storyteller systems.

Storyteller has a characteristic distribution of points that must be followed. Each sign and personality have their own traits and particularities, thus, they might have more or fewer points, although there's a "default" base. The sheet can be found here (both in english and portuguese).

## Point distribution
Points are divided in columns, which group specific ability or attribute types. The player gains N points that have to be distributed in each column of each item in the sheet.

### Example
Baldor Melcar, a Bosmer from Elden Root, is one of King Camoran's court mages. In his sheet, he has 7/5/3 points to be distributed between his Attributes, meaning that he may use 7 in one of the columns, 5 in another and 3 on the last one. Being a mage, he chose to use 7 points in the Mental Attributes column, 5 in the Social column and 3 in the Physical column. For his abilities, he has 13/9/5, and used 13 in the Knowledges column, 9 in the Skills column and 5 in the Talents column, giving the larger point group to the column that contains magical abilities, making the physical talents less important.

## Character levels
### Sheet levels
Levels in Amaranth are directly based on those seen in Elder Scrolls games. Each level has a different amount of points that may be distributed between the columns during character creation. The Narrator may choose the approach used for levels, but there's still a default rule the system offers. Novice is the most basic level, and the Narrator is free to add, remove or rename these levels at will.

* **Novice:** 7/5/3 (Attributes), 13/9/5 (Abilities), 3 (Spells), 5 (Backgrounds), 15 freebies.
* **Adept:** 10/8/6 (Attributes), 16/12/8 (Abilities), 6 (Spells), 8 (Backgrounds), 20 freebies.
* **Expert:** 13/11/9 (Attributes), 19/15/11 (Abilities), 9 (Spells), 11 (Backgrounds), 25 freebies.
* **Master:** 16/14/12 (Attributes), 22/18/14 (Abilities), 12 (Spells), 14 (Backgrounds), 30 freebies.
* **Grandmaster:** 19/17/15 (Attributes), 25/21/17 (Abilities), 15 (Spells), 17 (Backgrounds), 35 freebies.

## Ability points
Distributed points also follow a general rule for leveling, and that determines whether you can use a certain item or spell or not. For example, to use a steel sword, you need to be at least Adept in the Blade Skill. That requires between 3 and 4 points minimum.

* **Novice:** 1 to 2 points.
* **Adept:** 3 to 4 points.
* **Expert:** 5 to 6 points.
* **Master:** 7 to 8 points.
* **Grandmaster:** 9 to 10 points.

Pay attention to these titles when you select your gear. Your character won't be able to use items above their level.

# Attributes
Attributes are the character's personality traits. They're divided into 3 categories: Physical, Social and Mental. Read more in the [main article](/rules/sheet/attributes).

# Abilities
Abilities represent what the character can do. They're divided into 3 categories: Talents, Skills and Knowledges. Read more in the [main article](/rules/sheet/abilities).

# Advantages
## Spells
Spells are concentrated magic that allow the character to reach goals, attack, defend themself or change the world around them. Read more in the [main article](/magic/spells).

## Backgrounds
Traits that bring advantages to a character based on their backstory. Read more in the [main article](/rules/sheet/backgrounds).

## Merits & flaws
Personality, physical, social or mental traits a character may haves. Merits cost points, while flaws give you more points. Read more in the main article for [merits](/rules/sheet/merits) or [flaws](/rules/sheet/flaws).

## Magicka
**[Magicka](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Magic)** is the force that makes the arcane arts possible. It is said that Magicka comes to **[Mundus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mundus)** through **[Magnus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Magnus)**, the Sun, who is also Mundus' architect. It is possible to have a maximum of 50 Magicka points, and they're used to make magical actions. The character's Magicka pool is determined by the sum of their Willpower and Magic points (and this becomes the maximum limit when recharging Magicka, unless there a permanent increase somehow). Magicka is recharged when the character rests.

## Stamina
Stamina is the character's physical energy. It is used in blows and physical movements. It is determined by the sum of Endurance and Strength points (and this becomes the maximum limit when recharging Stamina, unless there a permanent increase somehow). Stamina is recharged when the character rests.

## Damage
Types of damage a character may have taken, and this varies from bruises to complete incapacitation. The sheet specifies these types, each one with its own penalty, that may be Bashing, Stunning, Lethal, Aggravated or Unconscious.
* **Bruised:** no penalty.
* **Hurt:** -1 die but no movement penalty.
* **Injured:** -1 die with movement slightly restrained.
* **Wounded:** -2 dice and the character may only walk.
* **Mauled:** -2 dice and movement's considerably restrained
* **Crippled:** -5 dice with almost impossible movement.
* **Incapacitated:** completely unconscious or immovable.

In the checkboxes, it is necessary to specify another damage type.
* **Bashing:** Draw a / in the checkbox. Uses stamina points to resist. Regenerates quickly.
* **Stunning:** When the damage taken is higher than the Endurance modifier. Loses the actions in the current turn but can act normally in the next. Must use the current action to resist the attack.
* **Lethal:** Draw an X in the checkbox. Uses stamina points to resist. Takes more time to regenerate.
* **Aggravated:** Draw a * in the checkbox. Uses Endurance and Stamina to regenerate. Takes longer to regenerate.
* **Unconscious:** Roll Endurance + Athletics. If the test succeeds, the character can get up, but takes -2 initiative in the next turn. If the roll fails, uses next action to get up, and also takes -2 initiative in the next turn. Critical failures allow the character to get up in the next turn, but they also take 1 in Bashing damage.

# Freebies
Freebies are additional points you get during character creation. They're used to buy traits. Read the [sheet levels section](/rules/sheet#sheet-levels) to find out how many freebies you get according to the level established by the Narrator for your character.

|Trait|Cost|
|---|---|
|**Attribute**|5 freebies per point|
|**Ability**|2 freebies per point|
|**Spell**|2 freebies per point|
|**Background**|1 freebie per point|
|**Magicka**|10 freebies per point|
|**Stamina**|10 freebies per point|
|**Artifact**|2 freebies per point|

# Experience
At the end of every session, the Narrator will give the players experience points. The criteria for point distribution are defined by the Narrator, but may include interpretation quality, learned lessons, character's deeds and/or more. These points are used to buy traits, just like freebies, but the pricing is slightly different.

|Trait|Cost|
|---|---|
|**Attribute**|current stat * 4|
|**Ability**|current stat * 2|
|**New ability**|3 points|
|**Magicka**|10 points|
|**Stamina**|10 points|

Spells aren't on this list because they're bought from NPCs, found in the world or given by the Narrator. They cannot be bought with EXP. The same applies to artifacts.
