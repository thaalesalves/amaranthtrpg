# Flaws

Flaws are negative character traits that give you points to be used in the sheet. Flaws vary from blindness to a dark destiny.

## Mental
### Absent mind (2 pt)
Although you won't forget your skills and talents thanks to a lot of practice, small details such as names, dates, numbers, addresses, etc. are almost lost on you. When you're under pressure, remembering things beyond your name require a mental test of Intelligence with a difficulty of 8.

### Addiction (1 pt. or 2 pt)
You need the presence of a certain substance in your body for it to function properly. When you're not under the effects of this substance for a time as long as your Willpower level, you need to roll a test of two attributes in everything you do. This flaw gives you ***+1 point** if your addiction is licit, such as alcohol or tobacco; it gives you **+2 points** if your vice is illicit, such as **[Skooma](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skooma)** or **[Moon Sugar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Moon_Sugar)**.

### Compulsion (1 pt. or 2 pt)
Some say it's a bad habit, but your psyche actually forces you to have this behavior. A compulsion that gives you **+1 point** is something like extreme cleanliness or hygiene, perfectionism, arrogance, speaking too much or too loudly. A compulsion of **+2 points** is something illegal, immoral or dangerous, such as kleptomania, sadism or radicalism. Through a successful roll of Willpower with a difficulty of 8 you can resist your compulsion.

### Curiosity (2 pt)
You **have** to know. It's like you were touched by **[Hermaeus Mora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hermaeus_Mora)**, because your curiosity is irrational. Puzzles, mysteries and enigmas pull you and don't let you go. To resist the tentation you need to do a mental test of Willpower with a difficulty of 8.

### Dark secret (1 pt)
There's something terrible in your past, something you simply have to hide. Maybe you used to be an active cultist of **[Molag Bal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Molag_Bal)**, or maybe you're the **[Gray Fox](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Gray_Fox)** himself. In any case, if this secret is discovered, you will probably end up dead, arrested... or worse.

### Mental deficiency (3 pt)
You were born with a mental disorder, and must choose one from the [list](/rules/sheet/flaws/deficiencies).

### Obsession (3 pt)
You are obsessed with the impossible. Certain impossible objectives drive your every effort, even though you have never achieved any of them. Make the **[Ashlanders](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashlanders)** and the rest of the **[Dunmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer)** get along, end the slavery caused by the **[Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Telvanni)** or put an end to the political fights between the **[Breton](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Breton)** **[nations](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock)** -- whatever it is, it's your highest priority, above any other loyalties or objectives.

### Soft hearted (1 pt)
You're a very empathic person, so seeing others suffer breaks your heart. Whenever you see someone in pain, you lose a die in tests until the end of the scene.

### Hatred (3 pt)
You have an irrational hatred for something or someone, and this makes you make terrible decisions. Even a casual mention to the object of hatred in a conversation is enough to put you on edge. In case you find it/them, you must roll a Willpower test - 1 (**MINUS ONE**). If it fails, you go intro a frenzy and simply destroy everything related to the object of hatred (unless the object runs away or gets out of your sight). The object of hatred cannot be something trivial, and must be something easily found in the game (i.e., a political faction or a public figure).

### Short tempered (2.pt)
You get irritated very easily, and has one fewer dice in tests when you're under pressure.

### Arrogance (1 pt)
You have an absurdly high self-confidence, to an astronomical level. You take risks others wouldn't, because you are too fucking awesome to doubt yourself even slightly. You normally don't accept help from others, since you can always count on yourself.

### Intolerance (1pt)
You have an irrational disdain for a specific something. You have one fewer dice in any test that involve the object of your intolerance. The object of hatred cannot be something trivial, and must be something easily found in the game.

### Illiterate (2 pt)
You have never learned to read or write in any language whatsoever. In case you want this flaw for your character, you need to make sure your backstory fits this. Talk to your Narrator for more information.

### Inaptitude (5pt)
Bottom line? You're dumb. You never learned to learn. You have basic abilities, know one thing or another, but have a huge difficulty to learn or understand things.

### Madness (5 pt)
You've been touched by **[Sheogorath](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sheogorath)**, the Mad God, and are now completely insane. You have constant paranoia, hallucinations and can even hear **[Haskill](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Haskill)** whispering in your ear saying that your master wants another cup of lemongrass tea and a block of cheese. It is not possible to resist the effects of madness.

## Physical
### Myopia (1 or 3 pt)
You were born with sight problems, and have difficulty to see. You lose two die in tests that require a better vision in longer distances, such as aiming or noticing clues high up in trees. In case glasses or magic fix your problem, you get **+1 point**. In case it's an unfixable problem, you get **+3 points**.

### Blindness (5 pt)
Whether you were born with this problem or it was caused by battles, you are completely blind. You fail every test that require vision.

### Monochromacy (1 pt)
You see everything in gray scale. Colors do not exist for you.

### Deafness (4 pt)
You cannot hear, because you either were born like this or something happened in your life that caused you to be deaf. You fail every test that requires hearing. You suffer from the Surprise effect with anyone that approaches you out of your field of view. You probably have a speech impediment as well, since your hearing ability directly affects your speaking.

### Disfiguration (2 pt)
You have visible scars or deformities, coming from birth or wounds. People remember you easily and may find you in a crowd. You lose two dice in every social test, with the exception of intimidation tests, and you cannot have any social impression traits.

### Muteness (4 pt)
Because you were born like this or because of something that happened in your life, you cannot speak. You need a pen and paper, or have a good level of linguistics with a sign language, or even some kind of magic, to be able to communicate with others.

### One-armed (3 pt)
Something happened and you lost an arm or a hand. You've become used to this condition, so your remaining member is considered the main on -- but you lose two dice on tests where hands are necessary.

### One-eyed (2 pt)
You lost an eye. Every roll that requires perception or sight, like ranged combat, has two fewer dice.

## Supernatural
### Arcane inaptitude (5 pt)
You have not been touched by **[Magnus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Magnus)** when you were born. Or rather, you were, but in a negative way. You are incapable of casting spells, and Magicka, **[Aetherius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aetherius)**'s natural force, does not flow in you. Your Magicka modifier falls to zero, and you are also unable to have temporary points.

### Dark fate (5 pt)
You know how your story ends: badly. Premonitions and visions of your macabre fate have haunted you for years. You are sure these visions will come true. The Narrator may give you visions during game sessions, and you will need to roll a Willpower test - 1 (**MINUS ONE**) for all challenges in the session. This is a restrict flaw and needs the Narrator's approval.

### Fear of demons (1 pt)
You are probably a loyal follower of the **[Nine Divines](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divines)**, or even the **[All-Maker](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:All-Maker)**, or maybe you're an atheist. It doesn't matter, you still have that deep fear inside of you, a fear that may be considered "dark magic", or even the fear that a **[Xiviliai](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Xiviliai)** might invade your home and take you to some plane of **[Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Oblivion)**. This flaw cannot be ignored, and in any scene with a supernatural being involved, your character will enter an irrational fear frenzy.

### Unlucky (7 pt)
It seems the Gods have forsaken you, and the Daedra took over your destiny. You suffer from an absurd bad luck, and may even cause harm to your loved ones. All your tests have their difficulty increased by two. Enemies have also an easier time damaging you, decreasing the difficulty of their rolls by one.
