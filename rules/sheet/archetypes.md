# Archetypes

The double faces of the archetypes of a character, Nature and Demeanor, point to personality traits that are above and under the public eyes, and are deeper than any aptitude or specific knowledges. A character's Nature is their "great truth": when everything fails and falls apart, that's what remains. The Demeanor is the essence of the character's external personality. Sometimes it's identical to their nature, but only when this character is what they seem to be... and this is not usually the case. In most cases, due to an internal denial, or an accumulation of justifications, or sometimes because they lie to themself, a person thinks they're something, and even acts as such, but their nature the opposite.

### Passionate
You're caring and passionate, always motivated by something or someone. Your passion motivates you in your every action, and it's like you were touched by **[Mara](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mara)** or **[Dibella](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dibella)**.

### Architect
You have an artistic sense, and try to create something that lasts, both for you and for the generations to come. You're the type of person that tries to make something meaningful: a tenement, a village, a city. Something that fulfills needs and help people.

### Artistic
You're creative and artistic. You have a good eye for art, and know how to appreciate the world around you. You create that which makes people be more than mere animals.

### Autocrat
It's your way or the highway. You always want to be in charge, not necessarily because you have the greater good in mind, although that sometimes is true. Your authority is above all, be it for your own good or for everyone else's. If you were a **[Daedric Prince](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Daedric_Princes)**, you'd probably be **[Molag Bal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Molag_Bal)**.

### Bon vivant
"Live slow, die whenever", this is your motto. You know life is empty and has no meaning. For that exact reason, you like to enjoy your lifetime. After all, at any moment it might end. You like to dance to the music, but you know that when it stops, you'll need to face the real world, and reality is too painful. Because of that you prefer to live in denial of your responsibilities, so you can simply enjoy your life. It's almost like you're connected to **[Sanguine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sanguine)** somehow.

### Bravo
You're a bully, a ruffian, a badass. Things always need to go according to your wishes, and you do not tolerate it when people disagree with you. Power is everything you respect. You don't see anything wrong in forcing your will on people.

### Bureaucrat
Laws exist for a reason, and you make sure to follow them. Rules were not made to be broken. Even society laws are harder to forget than some people may think. If no one follows the law, civilization collapses and chaos reigns supreme, and no one in their right mind would ever want that.

### Confidant
You understand people, and, more importantly, you like them. You're a facilitator, someone that listens and advises. People confess themselves to you, and, in return, you give them advice, more often than not good ones (even though your counsel might sometimes help yourself more than your confessor). You have a lot of interest in other people, and in who they are. Personalities fascinate you.

### Conformist
You're a follower. Taking charge simply doesn't match your style. It's easy for you to adapt and adjust, and get used to any new situation you're inserted into. You lean on the brightest star, and the person that makes you feel good. It is hard for you to go against the flow and rebel. You hate inconsistency and instability, and know that supporting a strong leader may prevent chaos from taking over.

### Conservative
You follow your country's, city's or region's tradition, or even your family's, as if they were the only truth possible. Every and any variation of these values is illegitimate and immoral, and cannot be taken seriously.

### Conspirator
Everyone is against you, and you're against everyone. Your objective is to knock down those who don't fit your values, and you are always involved in schemes. Molag Bal approves of your behavior.

### Cold hearted
Feelings are for cowards. A courageous person needs to bury them, and you can do that extremely well. You don't feel anything - or at least don't show it.

### Courteous
You're kind, because kindness begets kindness. You love doing good for people, and are always smiling true. Mara would be be very proud of you.

### Coward
You fear yourself above all. What you feel may not be demonstrated, or you will be rejected and will come to hate yourself. This separation from the real world is painful, so the Coward spends life waiting for love, validation and approval.

### Critic
Nothing in the world must be accepted without a detailed analysis. Nothing will ever be perfect, and flaws must be pointed out so the good things may be seen. Your bar is very high for absolutely everything, and you insist that your requirements are met. You encourage your ideals in others, as low parameters reduce quality of life for everyone.

### Caregiver
You always try to help those around you, fighting to make a difference in the needs and necessities of the unfortunate and disgraced. People around you depend on your stability and strength so they can keep centered and stable. You are the only one whom these people trust and ask for aid in times of need, like they would do Mara.

### Depraved
Some people just don't fit, and you're one of them. Your beliefs, motivations and sense of propriety are the antithesis of status quo. You are not a rebel without a cause, you're an independent thinker that doesn't fit the society you were born in. You don't care about people's morality, and you're attached to your own code of conduct.

### Diplomat
The world is full of people that would rather be right than in peace, idiots that think with their butt instead of their brains. Someone needs to gather everyone, make them sit down and talk their issues through. And who's better than you to do just that? You're patient, compassionate, and see everyone's sides in a problem. Even when others get tired of diplomacy, you keep yourself as the impartial moderator, neutral to the demands of other people, wishing nothing but peace, but without sacrificing anyone's rights or needs.

### Loner
You're a loner, and don't have anyone but yourself to count on. You see how "civilized" people cheat and scheme against each other, and you want no part in that. Friends are just people that will eventually try to use you, and every love eventually fades, and you will get emptier and emptier because of these attachments. You're a pessimist, and feel like everyone has failed you.

### Stoic
You accept life's unavoidable horrors. You're calm and serious, and hardly ever demonstrates emotions. This doesn't mean you're cold and emotionless, just means you avoid acting according to them, trying to think things through instead, always attempting to be rational with all your decisions. All people will ever see in you is a smile. Stoic people keep things to themselves, and eventually they might lose control and bursting out.

### Exiled
You were banished from your place of origin for whatever reason, and can't manage to fit anywhere else. You're a wanderer that knows new people and places all the time, but never stop in one place for too long, be it because people didn't like you or because you've simply grew tired of things. You always want something new.

### Explorer
There's an entire world out there, an no one really knows it very well. You're only content when you explore new territory, discovering what's out there, and bringing news to your close ones. You take risks so others don't need to, but also love the thrill of putting yourself in danger's way. At the same time, you know when it's best to just observe, and you've learned to move quietly whenever it is necessary. Despite fearing the unknown, you cannot ignore its call.

### Fanatic
You have a purpose, and this purpose consumes your very existence. You give your blood to your cause; of course, you feel guilty when you need to do something else than what helps you achieve your final goal. For you, the end justifies the means - the cause is more important than those who serve it. Whatever your cause may be, you will not stop until you reach it, and will run over those who dare stand in your way.

### Feudalist
You want power, lands, money and servants. It doesn't matter what you have to do, who you need to exploit or go to war against, as long as in the end you reach your goal: be powerful.

### Outlaw
You look at the world and see a sea of robots that don't have any grasp on reality. You believe that it is your obligation to exploit these people. How would they ever wake up without that? A thief, a charlatan, you take whatever you can from people without hesitation or remorse. If your victims are stupid enough to be victims, then why shouldn't abuse them?

### Outlander
Fetching n'wah, you damn s'wit! Wherever you are, you are not recognized as a citizen, and are always seen as an outlander. No one respects you enough, and they always see you as if you have come from another world.

### Futurist
Can this task be simpler? Then automate it. You have deep knowledge about **[Sotha Sil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sotha_Sil)**'s and the **[Dwemer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dwemer)** modern mechanic techniques, and you know how to build highly futuristic automatons. Things that would be unimaginable to most inhabitants of **[Tamriel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tamriel)**.

### Gallant
You're as extravagant as you're immoral; some see you as some kind of [Crassius Curio](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Crassius_Curio) - but you see yourself as better than that. An avid actor that loves making a show out of everything, and nothing catches your attention like an appreciative audience. You love people and loving impressing them even more. Despite the fact that you're an amazing lover, you love the dating game as much as the act per se.

### Genius
You have an extremely fast logic sense, are good with mathematics and calculus, and are very intelligent. You swallow books as if they were water, and are always working on something. You follow the teachings of **[Julianos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Julianos)**, **[Kagrenac](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Kagrenac)** and **[Sotha Sil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sotha_Sil)**, always trying to outgrow yourself when wits is the subject.

### Hermit
You're reclusive, and prefers your own company than someone else's. Introspective by nature, you see everything in a very personal manner. In public, you tend to be the quiet one, speaking only when spoken to, unless your opinion is of extreme relevance. Like a **[Greybeard](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Greybeards)**, people see you as a sage, since in the rare occasions when you speak, your words tend to make deep sense. Despite your wish to be in your own company, you have an enormous will to see and learn things.

### Childish
Adult life is simply infancy with hair around your body. You never ceased to be a teenager, and you still have the mind of one. You find things to be funny when people normally wouldn't, and can never take things too seriously. Be it because you never had a good childhood, or because you haven't accept that you've grown up.

### Arrogant
No one is better than you, and that needs to be made clear. You see fault in every and any person that crosses your path, and you make sure to let them know. You know everything about everyone, and know exactly what they've done wrong. Of course you do, you're better than them. And everyone needs to know that.

### Manipulator
You have always been fascinated by people. Why do people behave the way they do? What goes in their minds? The cognitive process that influences people's choices intrigues you. Sometimes, simply asking about people's actions may render important information, but sometimes people don't understand their own motivations and worries. In these cases, it's very easy to create situations - experiments, if you will - to see how people behave. You try to manipulate people and situations for your own personal gain. Some say that's cruelty, but for you this is done in the name of science.

### Masochist
You love testing your own limits, and finding out how much pain you can endure before you bend. Sometimes that makes you do accidental heroic deeds, but you always to do that for yourself, since you delight yourself in your own suffering. You get satisfied when you're humiliated, when you suffer, when you're reject, or even when you go through physical pain. You try to indoctrinate others into this philosophy, but you are not a sadist: your pleasure only regards your own pain.

### Martyr
You suffer for your cause, enduring judgments and pains, believing your suffering diminishes others'. You may like the attention or the sympathy people show you, or you may be sincere to your cause, saluting the opposition with an unshakable faith in your belief. You are the first to throw yourself in harm's way, knowing that your sacrifice will help your neighbors.

### Mystic
The world is a strange place, and you want to know more about it. If this includes esoterism, like alchemy or the geography of parallel planes, or even more "mundane" subjects such as the variations of magic or the fabric of the **[Creation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Annotated_Anuad)** of the **[Aurbis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Aurbis)**, you do not care. Knowledge matters most. Maybe you don't want to reveal your knowledge, but you like to study the unknown. You're like a **[Telvanni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Telvanni)**, **[Mannimarco](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mannimarco)** himself or even **[Shalidor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Shalidor)**. Any other subject may wait as long as there's magic, metaphysics and spirituality to hold your attention.

### Optimistic
"Everything will be all right in the end." This is your motto, and you know that if you keep smiling and unworried, your problems will never be with you for long. Some say you're a fool, but they have to admit you're happier than them. You definitely face difficulties sometimes, but there's no reason to worry in advance.

### Paladin
You follow your god, or pantheon, and that's all that matters. You would join the **[Knights of the Nine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Knights_of_the_Nine)**, or the **[Vigil of Stendarr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vigil_of_Stendarr)**, and you'd give your life for what you believe.

### Paranoid
Everyone is against you. Or are they? You act as if you were touched by Sheogorath, and put things where they're not. The more innocent the person looks, the worse they probably are, after all, if someone is too good, they're definitely no good at all. Everything is a show, everyone is acting, and they're out to take advantage of you. There's always a catch, small letters, that people expect you to agree to. You don't trust anyone, and you watch everyone as a hawk.

### Comrade
You value friendship over all else, and always try to prove you're worthy of people's trust. Other things might be important to you, but you're personal connections are above all else. You're willing to face any danger to help your friends in their times of need, even if they wouldn't do the same for you.

### Pedagogue
You know all, and you're desperate for everyone to know that. If there's a sense of purpose or a genuine wish to help others, you simply wish your message to be heard - thoroughly, if necessary.

### Perfectionist
You can't stand imperfection, be it in you or anyone else. You don't tolerate those who don't do all they can for things to be perfect and correct. Despite you being restrictive of others, you're more critic of yourself - everything always needs to be in its place, and you always have to do your best, and be good at everything.

### Predator
You divide the world into prey and hunter, and you prefer to be the hunter type. There's no thrill like that of the hunt -  you can have a weaker prey just for training your skill (or for the hell of it), but the best victim is the smart one, the apt one, the one that is as good as you. You may hunt animals for food, but you live for the hunt of more intelligent creatures. You don't necessarily kill what you capture, but you love to prove your excellence for being good enough for having captured your prey. Your glory is in the Hunt, just like **[Lord Hircine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hircine)** wants.

### Trickster
You're the divine trickster, the clown, he who laughs last, longest and best. Because you believe there's no meaning in the world, there's no reason for anything, so you delight yourself in ruining other people's lives. You feel as if that is almost your obligation, you're an agent of **[Sithis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sithis)**, a child of **[Lorkhan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lorkhan)**, and need to cause mayhem everywhere. You need to knock people down from their pedestals and dogmas, and make them swallow words of nobility and honor. Sometimes, you work for weeks, months or even years, formulating your tricks, laying the foundations, and carefully placing your traps for your victim to fall for it... and fall good.

### Rebel
You don't accept the system the way it is. Something needs to change, and you know exactly what and how to do it. Or maybe not. You act as an agent of **[Mehrunes Dagon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mehrunes_Dagon)**, and want to change the world and break the current order.

### Saint
You feel the pain of those around you, and do everything to end their suffering. You let go of your time, your belongings and any other thing to increase the happiness of those around you. This usually makes you a martyr. You happiness is secondary, others matter most. You can be so obsessed about your cause that you end up in danger, despite never doing anything that puts others in harm's way. You follow the teachings of Mara, and are always looking to do good and living a simple life, encouraging others to do the same.

### Wise
You're the counselor, the sage, the teacher. You've traveled around the world, and have seen a lot. You've learned, and is willing to teach. The search for knowledge and wisdom is the main goal of your life. You see something that can be learned about in every situation. Like the sage in the mountain, you don't force your wisdom down people's throats, but you share it with an open heart with those that are willing to hear it.

### Hard worker
You're a hard worker, and won't stop for even a minute to rest. You like to provide to those you sustain and keep people around you comfortable and stable. You follow the teachings of **[Zenithar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Zenithar)**, and are always trying to contribute in a meaningful and useful way.

### Merchant
There's no such thing as free lunch, and anyone who believes there is is an idiot that needs a lesson. You don't trust situations where it's not possible to inspect the merchandise and know the price of stuff, you always try to find the catch, because there's always a catch. Naturally, you make a living out of seeling things - maybe something you manufacture, possess, have stolen, or you might even sell your self as a mercenary - or in any other way. You never give anything away, for no one buys a cow when they can get the milk for free.

### Visionary
You're strong enough to see through the mundane world. You test socially accepted limits and question authorities: not because you want to destroy the order of things, but because you need to make your dreams come true. You question what could be done instead of what is being done. You have an ample vision, but you're highly naïve. Your charisma and vision may threaten others, or maybe win them over, depending on how they feel about your deeds.
