# Alchemy
Created by the [Direnni](https://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:De_Rerum_Dirennis) of **[High Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock)**, **[Alchemy](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alchemy)** is the art of mixing, boiling, distilling and brewing various substances to obtain their concentrated magi-alchemical properties to create potions and poisons.

## Brewing potions and poisons
Alchemy in Amaranth was directly based on the mechanics used by **Elder Scrolls Online** and **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**, where the player needs at least two ingredients to make the infusion. The purity of the water or oil used to brew the potion determine the quality of the potion or poison prepared, respectively. Recipes are necessary to create the infusions, since it is necessary to know the effects of each ingredient. The character may also risk mixing random ingredients to see the results. In case the character does not have a recipe to a potion, the difficulty of the rolls is increased by +2. In case they do have a recipe, then the roll has the default difficulty. In case the infusion has four ingredients but doesn't have a recipe, the difficulty is then increased by +4. The modifiers used for the roll are Intelligence + Alchemy, and then Water/Oil + Ingredients. The first test defines how well the action succeeded, and the second determines if the action has in fact been done.

**Example:** Annelise Durine needs a health potion. She has some **Cleansed Water** she got from **[Coldharbour](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Coldharbour)**, an **Ambrosia** and an **Eye of Sabre Cat**. She rolls her Alchemy + Intelligence, and gets **(5, 4, 6, 7, 10)**. Four successes. She did well. The next text is for the Ingredients + Water. 3 dice will be rolled for the water (as Cleansed Water is the third type of water), +1 die per ingredient, summing up to 5 dice. **(2, 8, 6, 10, 7)**. Five successes. She succeeded in creating her health potion.

## Potions, poisons and ingredients
Amaranth uses the default ingredients from the series, but in the mechanic described above. The Narrator is free to create their own ingredients, but the default ones may be used as well.

### Solvents
As mentioned above, it is necessary to have a solvent to produce the brews, and the solvent's quality will determine the final result. The list of solvents Amaranth uses is based on that from Elder Scrolls Online, but adapted to the levels Amaranth provides. To brew a potion, water will be required as a solvent. For a poison, oil is used as the solvent. The possibility of use of each solvent is based on the character's Alchemy level.
